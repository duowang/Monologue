Stephen Colbert,"The Supreme Court has decided to hear Trump’s immunity claim, further delaying his January 6 trial in the landmark case: ‘The People v. Do Laws Matter? Seriously, What Is Going On?! Justice Deferred Is Justice Gutted Like a Fish and Thrown in the River For Chum! One More of These Steaming Turds and I Swear to God on the Ghost of John Marshall I Will Drive to Washington and Rub My Ass on Your Gavels!'” Stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,That makes it a total of 19 weeks of delays. These proceedings have been frozen for so long they legally count as children in Alabama.
Stephen Colbert,That is terrible news for democracy but fantastic news for television. All of the plotlines will come together for the thrilling conclusion of… America .
Stephen Colbert,"As we say in New York [to the tune of “New York, New York"
Stephen Colbert,"Trump’s lawyers argued that he can’t post the whole bond because he doesn’t have the money without selling a building. Then sell a building, bitch!"
Stephen Colbert,Sell Trump Tower. New York can redevelop it. First floor—weed store. Second floor—weed store. Third floor—pet groomer… that sells weed.
Stephen Colbert,"In Dobbs , the Court stripped women of their rights, and to justify it, Sam Alito cited a 17th century witch-hunter. Evidently he believes medical decisions are between a woman, her doctor and the mischievous imp who inflamed her loins with his alluring pan flute."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump’s argument is that he could literally shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And I’ve got to be honest, if this holds up I’m worried that this person he shoots might be me."
Jimmy Kimmel,This is what happens when you let an extra from Home Alone 2 pick three Supreme Court Justices.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He owes, like, a whole Powerball jackpot."
Michael Kosta,[Trump] is saying he needs to delay the cases so he can prepare for the other ones. It’s like when Arnold Schwarzenegger’s getting attacked by two guys and he bonks their heads together and they’re both out for the rest of the movie. “ Michael Kosta
Michael Kosta,"I’m sorry but if you can pass through a spaghetti strainer, that’s not human."
Michael Kosta,Why would you want to criminalize one of the only time you can masturbate for a good cause?
Michael Kosta,"The FDA is gonna make a logo to help people choose healthy foods. Which, good luck with that. This is America, it’s a victory if we can get people to unwrap things before eating them."
Jimmy Fallon,"Some people are blaming the Supreme Court for dragging it out on purpose to help Trump, so today the Justices responded. First, Justice Elena Kagan said, ‘We should be acting faster to move this along.’ Then Justice Samuel Alito said, “I… totally… agree… with… you…"
Jimmy Fallon,I read that Merriam-Webster announced that you can now end a sentence with a preposition. That is huge news everyone for.
Seth Meyers,"Now the good news is, we can all be happy that things have been moving so quickly. It’s only February and this is a trial about January 6—until you remember it was January 6 three [expletive] years ago, and you start going, ‘Why the f— did it take you so f—ing long to start this f—ing case when we all saw the f—ing insurrection on f—ing TV with our f—ing eyes?!’"
Seth Meyers,Look at that s—hole. It looks like a Medieval Times ripoff called Serf’s Up.
Seth Meyers,"Aw, poor Donald Trump. I don’t feel sorry for him, I was describing him."
Seth Meyers,"The fast food chain Wendy’s is facing backlash after they announced plans this week to experiment with a new ‘dynamic pricing’ system. You know, like how the bathroom code is free if you order a salad or five bucks if you order the chili."
Seth Meyers,"Former President Trump yesterday posted a video to Truth Social that referenced our show as ‘very poorly rated.’ Wow, the guy tells the truth one time and it has to be a burn on me."
