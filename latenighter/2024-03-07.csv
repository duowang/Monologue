Stephen Colbert,"America will never forget you… oooh, I wan’t to say Narky Stanley? Nibbly Snacky? Sticky Hale-Bopp?"
Stephen Colbert,"Yeah, Vermont! Which means, by law, she gets her own Ben & Jerry’s flavor. So keep and eye out for Half-Baked Explanation of How Slavery Didn’t Cause the Civil War."
Stephen Colbert,"That headline again, ‘Tortoise Endorses Hair.'"
Stephen Colbert,[Trump] did especially well in the few states where he isn’t currently on trial.
Stephen Colbert,"In North Carolina, even though Trump took the state, one in four Republican voters said they would be ‘dissatisfied’ if Trump got the nomination. Really? Just ‘dissatisfied?’ We’re talking about an existential threat to the republic, not clicking the frowny face at the airport bathroom. ‘How was the gulag? Huh, out of paper towels.'"
Stephen Colbert,"He then slammed his bedroom door, blasted My Chemical Romance, and said he wasn’t even hungry for dinner but could he have chicken fingers."
Stephen Colbert,Biden is now adding the entire Phillips coalition. It’s a big tent. Sleeps two.
Stephen Colbert,"Now you may be asking, ‘Who is Jason Palmer. The answer is ‘yes.'"
Stephen Colbert,This guy makes Dean Phillips look like Ryan Binkley. And if you know who either of those people are then you’re too invested in politics. Go see Dune or something.
Stephen Colbert,"That New York Times poll is a mess. It found Trump winning the female vote by one percent when Biden carried women in 2020 by 11 points. Somehow I doubt Trump has won by back 12 percent of women with his inspiring message, ‘I’m a rapist!'"
Ronny Chieng,"But I swear to God, if you turn around end endorse Trump I will… totally expect it."
Ronny Chieng,"Don’t quit now, Nikki, you were only 80,000 delegates behind! If you drop out who will little girls without any principles, convictions or charisma look up to?"
Ronny Chieng,"What is wrong with your brain, apart from that thing that is obviously wrong with your brain?"
Ronny Chieng,"This guy is going down there like, “Hey, I’m the most famous guy in America—you guys don’t have the internet, right?"
Seth Meyers,"Why would anyone in the Republican Party give a damn about the GOP pledge when the guy who runs the GOP has never been bound by any pledge in his life. He hasn’t been bound by a pledge to remain faithful in his marriages, a pledge to honor the Constitution, a pledge to pay his taxes, or a pledge not to tell people to cure Covid by drinking Pledge."
Seth Meyers,"At least we think that McConnell endorsed Trump. Halfway through, he froze and switched over to an old Windows screensaver."
Seth Meyers,"Well, here we are, you guys. Donald Trump is now the presumptive GOP nominee for president. Again. For the third time. Despite the fact that he is a twice-impeached, four-time criminal indictee and racist who’s been found liable for fraud and sexual abuse, banned for doing business in the state of New York for three years, owes over half a billion dollars in fines, took millions from foreign governments while he was president, tried to extort a foreign country to interfere in an election in 2020, and encouraged another to help him win in 2016… actively undermined the nation’s response to a once in a lifetime pandemic and let a deadly disease spiral out of control, is about to go on trial for breaking campaign finance laws for paying hush money to cover up an affair during the 2016 campaign… orchestrated a months-long coup attempt that culminated in a violent insurrection to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power and install him as an unelected dictator… stole classified documents and obstructed attempts to try and get them back, has never once won the popular vote and has been routinely rejected by a majority of Americans in election after election… spews deranged conspiracy theories about everything from climate change to immigration to vaccines, to windmills… glitches on three-syllable words, two-syllable words, and one-syllable words, cheats at golf, can’t spell his own name, his wife’s name, of the words ‘indicted,’ ‘education,’ ‘unprecedented,’ ‘stolen,’ ‘Denmark,’ ‘Kentucky,’ or ‘tap,’ and is, on top of everything else, the single weirdest and most off-putting human being on the face of the f***ing planet. And this is the same planet Ted Cruz lives on.” seth meyers"

Seth Meyers,"Oh that’s weird, it was working fine six months ago when I signed up for it and never looked at it again."
Jimmy Fallon,"But here’s the good news for Haley, she’s only 52. So that means she can run for president at least eight more times."
Jimmy Fallon,"Now it’s pretty much certain we’re gonna have a rematch between Biden and Trump. At this point, the only thing that could stop them is a flight of stairs."
Jimmy Fallon,"Meanwhile, Donald Trump thinks American Samoa is a Girl Scout cookie."
Jimmy Fallon,"Biden’s [State of the Union] speech will be carried by all of the major networks, like NBC, CBS, and ABC. Which means the big winners tomorrow will be Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon."
