Jon Stewart,"I don’t want to be a nitpicker, but I do not remember the assassination episode of Schoolhouse Rock ."
Jon Stewart,"I believe it was Thomas Jefferson who once said, ‘Our liberty depends on of the freedom of the press—though obviously, as with any right, there is some wiggle room for non-consensual ass-f**king.'"
Jon Stewart,What the f**k are we doing? You know I’m pretty sure that shooting a guy on suspicion of stealing a pair of khakis violates not only the Constitution but the Ten Commandments and also the Gap employee handbook.
Jon Stewart,"Biden’s back, baby! I know that all the haters have been out there, talking their s**t. ‘He’s too old! He’s too weak! He won’t make it! He won’t be able to stand!’ I see you haters, I know who you are!"
Stephen Colbert,"According to [former Trump Chief of Staff] John Kelly, in private, Trump—how can I put this delicately?—loves Hitler. In fact, Trump told Kelly, ‘Well, Hitler did some good things.’ And the category is, ‘Phrases that should end your candidacy and/or birthday party.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Kelly bravely asked Trump which good things Hitler did, and Trump responded, “Well, he rebuilt the economy… and that’s the end of his story as far as I know.'"
Stephen Colbert,"That’s called a dictatorship, sir. In a democracy, it can be hard to put even a guilty guy in jail. For instance, uh, what’s his name?"
Stephen Colbert,So it turns out the Nazis had a bit of a dark side?
Stephen Colbert,"It’s a good thing he held onto that card, ’cause we might have seen his Maestro , if you know what I’m sayin’. His Poor Thing , if you catch my drift. His, uh, his Oppen -penis."
Stephen Colbert,"Wow, you really wanna go there? First of all Biden didn’t stutter like that. Second, if you want to make this a word-talkin’ contest, you are one of the weirdest speakers in human history."
Stephen Colbert,"We only have two candidates left, and they have starkly different messages. Biden’s message is, ‘Vote for me because Trump is terrible.’ Trump’s message is, ‘Vote for me because I am terrible.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yesterday, the U.K. celebrated Mother’s Day. Or as they call it, ‘Bangers and Mum.'"
Seth Meyers,"You think Facebook is the enemy of the people? Dude, have you ever been on Facebook? Everyone’s uncle is on there and they love you."
Seth Meyers,So you talked to a bunch of doctors who told you all the symptoms of dementia. Are you sure they weren’t your doctors? I would say the first sign of dementia is going in for a doctor’s appointment and thinking you’re the one interviewing the doctor.
Seth Meyers,"When the Biden team heard [Sean] Hannity say the phrase ‘Jacked Up Joe’ that many times, I bet they said, ‘Thank you for the kick-ass new nickname.’"
Seth Meyers,"Now, we can’t legally say that Trump is on drugs, but he does look like every side effect from a drug commercial. Sweats like crazy, gets cotton mouth, has trouble seeing the teleprompter, and glitches like his brain is an exploding Rube Goldberg machine."
Seth Meyers,Nobody’s ever needed to say ‘I’m not a doctor’ less than Jesse Watters.
Seth Meyers,That’s Marjorie Taylor Green at the State of the Union looking like she got fired by a Russian airline for wearing too much flair.
Seth Meyers,"Republicans keep coming up with better messaging for Biden than Biden does. He co-opted the Dark Brandon memes and made them a staple of his campaign. Meanwhile, Democrats came up with the slogan—and this is real—’Together we will defeat Donald Trump. Again.’ Here’s how you know a campaign slogan sucks—when it’s two sentences. That’s like if Obama’s was, ‘Yes we can. Can win an election I mean.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"They kept demanding that they make the envelope bigger and bigger. First of all, I have to say congratulations to John Cena. Very rarely does an idea literally push the envelope."
Jimmy Kimmel,We had John Cena on stage naked and somehow Trump still managed to be the biggest dick of the night.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He wasn’t getting any attention, he couldn’t stand it, and so then the Adderall McFlurry kicked in."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Toward the end of the broadcast, Donald Trump… wrote, ‘Has there EVER been a WORSE HOST than Jimmy Kimmel at the Oscars? His opening was that of a less than average person trying to too hard to be something which he is not and never can be.’ This was also his wedding toast to his son, Eric."
Jimmy Fallon,"I mean, God bless John [Cena]. I could never do something like that. If I did, I’d win the Oscar for Best Short."
Jimmy Fallon,"Oppenheimer was the big winner, taking home seven awards including Best Picture. While the award for most paused picture went to John Cena."
Jimmy Fallon,"Airbnb has banned indoor home security cameras, so now if you want to be creepily spied on you’ll have to stay at Motel 6."
