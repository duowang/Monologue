Stephen Colbert,"That kind of assessment is sort of outside the normal job description of a special counsel. It’d be like your doctor saying, ‘Well, we ran some tests, Mr. Johnson and your cholesterol looks very good, but I am worried about how ugly you are.’ stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"Now, may I follow up on that one? What if Joe Biden was a strapping young buck. Age 35, with sun-bleached hair, washboard abs, that little V muscle down here. I mean, tight. With fire in his eyes and a soul full of sin. Would you be tempted to charge him with unforgivable crimes of sultry passion?"
Stephen Colbert,"At one point, Hur even complimented Biden’s memory, saying, ‘You appear to have a photographic understanding and recall.’ So the exact opposite of his report summary. At this point, I’ m worried about Hur’s cognitive ability. Did anyone ask him to identify a whale?"
Stephen Colbert,"Look. I’m no fan of Hur, but the guy had a tough job. ‘Mr. President, with all due respect, would it possible to answer the question without a trip to the basement to see the model trains?'"
Stephen Colbert,"What a beautiful name… that I am being told right right now I am pronouncing incorrectly. It is in fact pronounced ‘Chumley.’ Counterpoint, no it’s not. Learn English, England."

Stephen Colbert,"Now the witness’ name is Brian Butler. That’s right—the Butler did it. Previously known in court documents only as ‘Trump Employee Number 5.’ Trump Employee Number 5 also, by the way, Chanel’s worst selling fragrance."
Stephen Colbert,"[Butler stated that] he and others ‘moved boxes from Mar-a-Lago to the airport at the same time that federal investigators were visiting Trump to discuss returning the classified materials.’ That is insane. He’s doing the exact crime he’s being investigated for while he’s being investigated for the crime… ‘Identity theft? Officer, I would never. I swear on your mother’s maiden name, which was what again?'” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"In exchange for loyalty, Trump may have dangled the promise of legal representation as a reward. Though I gotta say, Trump picking your lawyer is about the worst reward I can imagine. ‘Okay, do you want the one who drinks so much that he pees Shiraz, the one who farts in court, or the one whose head is dripping with mystery ooze? Trick question, it’s all the same guy.'"
Michael Kosta,"Biden’s age has been a central fact in the campaign, which is what happens when you’re 154 years old."
Michael Kosta,You know how I know that’s fake? There’s three kids smiling at the same time.
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s pretty amazing, Biden’s interview lasted five hours but Hur only asked one question."
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, five hours of Biden talking. Or as his grandkids call it, a voicemail."

Jimmy Kimmel,"But they were all attached to a big wooden spoon, so they were safe."
Jimmy Kimmel,Every guy that’s been with Trump for years looks like the doorman at a strip club.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Of course, the last time Trump asked for votes in Georgia he was indicted for it. Turns out you have to do it before the election."
Seth Meyers,"According to a new book, former President Trump has praised Adolph Hitler in private conversation with aides, and once said, ‘Hitler did some good things.’ Oh come on, I don’t believe he said that once."
Seth Meyers,"According to a new survey, 95 percent of U.S. teens have access to a smart phone. Said the other five percent, ‘ Mom .. ? ’"
Seth Meyers,"The White House announced yesterday that Housing Secretary Marcia Fudge would be stepping down. Said Mike Pence, ‘There’s no need to curse.'"
Seth Meyers,"Angry TikTok users are reportedly calling congressional offices ahead of this week’s vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban the platform. [Puts up picture of the January 6 insurrection] Well, it’s more mature than what angry Facebook users did."
Seth Meyers,"The Russian presidential election ends on Sunday, but Putin expects his opponent will drop out. Of a window."
Seth Meyers,"According to a new report, Boeing failed more than one third of recent FAA audits on its production process for its 733 MAX jet. So unlike their planes, they are totally screwed."
Desi Lydic,"This is the most mean girl introduction I have ever heard. ‘A lot of people think you need to be qualified to get a job, but here’s Lara Trump!'"
