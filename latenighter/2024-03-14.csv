Seth Meyers,"[On Biden investigator Robert Hur’s disastrous appearance before a congressional hearing into discrepancies between his summary and the actual transcript] “He reportedly got help from right-wing operatives connected to Donald Trump to prepare for his testimony yesterday. Although I can’t imagine what kind of advice he got from Trumpworld. Did they show him Trump’s courtroom sketches to prepare? ‘Okay, the best way to make yourself seem credible and trustworthy during testimony is to grimace like you’re passing a gallstone, grimace like you’re passing a second, bigger gallstone, grimace like you just saw your wife having sex with Grimace, then just hold your hands up like you’re waiting for them to slap the cuffs on you.’” seth meyers"
