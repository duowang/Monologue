Jimmy Kimmel,"This is a historic case. Not only is it the first time a former president has been charged with illegally removing and withholding classified documents, it’s also the first time a former president has used classified documents to decorate his bathroom."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump was in court today for a hearing on one of the four criminal cases he’s facing. The funny thing about these hearings is you don’t know if he’s gonna show up. He doesn’t have to come, but it’s sometimes—it’s like when you go on a boat, sometimes you see a whale and sometimes you don’t."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Much of the focus has been on the judge in this case, Judge Aileen Cannon, whose rulings so far have a hint of favoritism toward Trump. Trump appointed her to the job, so this is like if Eddie Murphy got hauled in front of Judge Reinhold."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The truth is that the Deep State, which is based in Green Bay, Wisconsin, by the way. Deep State headquarters in is a factory in Hobart that makes the cheese for the pedophile pizza places, but that’s a story for another night. Anyway, what the Deep State won’t tell you is that Aaron Rodgers never played football, he’s not a football player. He faked his entire career. In fact, the first time he ever played in an NFL game was last year. The week before his first game with the Jets, Aaron Rodgers’ body double, the guy who’d played every single game for him before this, died of Covid and they had nobody dumb-looking enough to fill in. So they had to bring in the real Aaron Rodgers and he had to go in and fake an injury on the third play of opening day, that’s why he only threw one pass. And you don’t have to believe me on this, do your own research. And maybe when you do, you’ll notice that the Bible says that the number eight represents a new beginning, a new order, and man’s true born-again event when he’s resurrected from the dead into eternal life. And guess what number Aaron Rodgers chose to wear when he ‘played’ for the Jets? Anyone? That’s right, number eight. Wow. That story, by the way, is more believable than what Aaron Rodgers said really happened at Sandy Hook.” jimmy kimmel"
Seth Meyers,"But they’re not his. They were marked classified. If they’re marked classified, they can’t be your personal property. The only people who mark their personal property classified are teenagers who definitely want someone to read their diary."
Seth Meyers,"[On a Mar-a-Lago whistleblower’s report that Trump showed American military secrets to Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt] ” An Australian billionaire got top secret information about U.S. and Russian submarines. Thankfully, the good news is he couldn’t share any of the information because it’s impossible to say ‘submarine’ in an Australian accent.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"That’s the literal definition of buying access. A billionaire gave Trump money to be a member of his club and, in return, Trump gave that billionaire sensitive national security secrets. It’s insane, I mean who else was Trump selling access to? Spies, lobbyists, anyone Trump talks to. So basically everyone except Eric."
Seth Meyers,"Former President Trump referred to himself this week in a post on Truth Social as ‘Honest Don.’ And at this point I gotta believe even he’s being sarcastic. Nobody who’s honest puts ‘honest’ in front of their name. If there’s a place called Honest Don’s in your hometown, it’s either a used car dealership or a pawn shop. Maybe a pizza place, but not the good one."
Seth Meyers,"All right, you’re having a hard enough time with the Gen Z vote. What else are you gonna do, cancel Euphoria ?"
Seth Meyers,"After the House passed a bill that would force the sale of TikTok, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called on the Senate to ‘take swift action’ on the legislation.

Seth Meyers,A new report said that Americans are expected to spend over 7.2 billion dollars on St. Patricks Day. And that’s with insurance.
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, so he has the power to declare presidential records personal records. And as a result they are no longer presidential records because, as president, they belonged to him personally. ‘As you can see officer, I couldn’t have stolen the car because I have it.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Saying you did something ‘very legally’ really makes it sound like you broke the law. ‘Look, I went for a drive very legally, very soberly, and I drove into extremely no living rooms, and as a result a tremendous amount of my wife is never divorcing me.'"
Stephen Colbert,"You know something went wrong when you’re asked to leave Twitter. ‘I’m sorry, but you’re no longer welcome in our community of flat-Earth incel Nazis.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Totally normal way to say that. Reminds me of my favorite Michael Jackson album, In Terms of Badly ."
Stephen Colbert,"Then do it, coward. Trump/Bernie 2024."
Stephen Colbert,"Franken-Sheep”] “That is awful. Not only because the most annoying guy you know just said, ‘Actually, it’s Franken-Sheep’s monster.'"
Michael Kosta,"To be fair to Elon though, you never really expect to hire someone and then immediately be asked about the Great Replacement Theory. Usually want to wait for the Christmas party to do that."
Michael Kosta,These ‘alpha males’ today get one tough question and they start whining like my kid when I tell him he can’t watch Cars 2 for their eighth time today.
Desi Lydic,"When life gives Musk lemons, he fires them."
Desi Lydic,"Donald Trump has had a good week. He sealed the GOP nomination, one of his 54 trials was postponed, and he just figured out you can Google ‘boobs.’"
