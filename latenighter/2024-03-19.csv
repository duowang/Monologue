Jimmy Fallon,"Today, former President Trump’s lawyers say that Trump is unable to pay the 454 million dollar bond in his New York civil fraud case. In his defense, how is a billionaire ever supposed to come up with half a billion dollars?"
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump is pretty desperate for the money. Right now if you go on Airbnb, you can rent Trump Tower Mar-a-Lago and Eric."
Jimmy Fallon,"Of course, March Madness picks have to be in by this Thursday, and… my bracket’s already busted. How did that happen?"
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s Spring Break and March Madness. This is actually a crazy time for kids and parents. Right now students are on Spring Break like, ‘Dad, can you send bail money?’ And the dad’s like, ‘Depends if UConn makes the Sweet 16.'"
Jimmy Fallon,But I can’t wait for March Madness. I can’t wait to see who wins and how it’s connected to a conspiracy about Taylor Swift.
Jimmy Fallon,"A man in New York had a 750-pound alligator seized from his home. When it’s a 750-pound alligator, I think the pet might actually be you. “ Jimmy Fallon"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump’s lawyers today told the court they can’t find anyone to put up the 454 million dollar bond he needs to cover what he owes the state of New York. They say they approached about 30 bond companies, none of whom would do business. Gee, I wonder why. Can you imagine that call? ‘Hi, we represent Donald Trump. We were wondering if you could, hello..?’"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I mean, who would ever have guessed that a hard-earned reputation for not ever paying your bills would make it difficult to get credit?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"The more this election goes, the more [Trump] talks like Thanos."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump told the crowd that if he doesn’t win in November, he’s not sure we’ll ever have another election in this country. And if he does win in November, we definitely won’t have another election."
Jimmy Kimmel,"While Trump is busy trying to get his oval ass back in the Oval Office, his former Vice Poodle is not being a good boy. It’s like the Stockholm syndrome finally wore off."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Biden also invited 30 members of the Kennedy family [to the White House]. Look at that, it’s a who’s-who of who won’t be voting for cousin Robert this year."
Jimmy Kimmel,"St. Fatty had an interview with Fox News yesterday and apparently he’s still stewing about a joke I made about him at the Oscars. Donald Trump said I’m not talented so many times, Eric is starting to get jealous."
