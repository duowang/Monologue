Jon Stewart,"‘There is a theory in law that if enough people commit a crime, it automatically becomes legal. You’re familiar with The Purge , are you not?'"

Well, it turns out that, for a decade, whenever Trump wanted to get a loan or make a deal, he’d he’d illegally inflate the value of his real estate. For instance, suggesting that his 11 thousand square foot penthouse was a 30 thousand square foot penthouse. We all do it. I mean on my drivers license, I’m not listed as 5′ 7″, I’m listed at 30 thousand square feet.” jon stewart"
