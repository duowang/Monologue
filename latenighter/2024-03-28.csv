Stephen Colbert,"In case you’re unfamiliar with McDaniel, she is… terrible."
Stephen Colbert,"As head of the RNC, Ronna repeatedly claimed that the 2020 election was rigged, helped Trump’s campaign assemble fake electors, and even was on a call with Trump when he pressured election officials not to certify vote totals in a key Michigan county. Happy Women’s History Month gals! It’s 2024, you too can be morally bankrupt, dictator-enabling douche-nuggets!"
Stephen Colbert,"I haven’t seen on-air talent rebel like that since Elmo said, ‘The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation can kiss Elmo’s furry butt. So can viewers like you!'"
Stephen Colbert,take one for the team
Stephen Colbert,"Reportedly, they’ve been asking any potential hires whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen. Yes, if you wanna work at the RNC, you’ve got to believe Trump’s big lie. The other interview questions include, ‘How sexy is Donald Trump, on a scale of Hubba Hubba! to Boi-oi-oi-ng! ‘ and ‘Will you give me $60 for this flag Bible?'"
Stephen Colbert,many” Bibles personally] “He has to have spare Bibles because any time he holds one it bursts into flames.
Stephen Colbert,"Yes! Donald Trump is now hawking a Bible! its just like any other good book, except in the middle of this one there’s a centerfold."
Stephen Colbert,"Who doesn’t love Lee Greenwood’s hit, ‘God Bless the U.S. A.’ And his other big hits like… ‘Thank You for Blessin’ the U.S.A., God.'"
Stephen Colbert,"So you’re spending 60 dollars on public domain writing.[Trump voice] ‘If you order now, you’ll get all the lyrics to ‘Camptown Races,’ and a picture of Jesus’ most beloved disciple, Steamboat Willie.'"
Stephen Colbert,What if my Bible has sticky pages?
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, that’s positive, but, it raises a disturbing question. How do you gag someone who speaks out of their ass? The answer—very carefully."
Stephen Colbert,"Come on, Velveeta isn’t fake. It’s full of all natural ingredients, like… yellow. And rectangle."
Stephen Colbert,They wanted their own stories about Trump cheating
Jordan Klepper,"Yes, Ronna McDaniel lasted only five days on NBC. Which is less screen time than dead bodies on Law & Order get."
Jordan Klepper,"hostages”] “I wouldn’t call convicted criminals hostages. Although if MAGA wants to treat them as hostages, we could have a hostage exchange. I’m happy to release them if they, I don’t know, could give us the old Kanye back."
Jordan Klepper,"We can’t normalize this. Do you remember when he wasted three moths of our lives being mad at Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem? Now he’s saluting rioters, insurrectionists, and, even worse, a cappella singers."
Jordan Klepper,"QAnon Shaman” Jacob Chansley’s run for Congress in Arizona] “Real solutions? What solutions could you possibly have? ‘Social Security is in trouble, have you tried beating it with a flagpole?'"
Seth Meyers,"Yep, the guy who’s about to go on trial for paying hush money to cover up an affair with a porn star is sellin’ Bibles. And, because it’s a Trump Bible, most of the commandments are blacked out."
Seth Meyers,"Great, so now the only thing separating church and state is a bookmark."
Seth Meyers,"So the judge said Trump can’t attack witnesses, jurors, prosecutors, or court staff. But he also issued a list of things Trump can continue to attack, including: toilets, windmills, spell check, dogs, the Oscars, the NFL, teleprompters, horses, whales, and ‘Joe Buden’—whoever that is."
Seth Meyers,"I don’t know, man. A desperately uninformed TV personality who looks like the greeter at a steakhouse is getting 30 million dollars a year to whine on Fox News every night—sounds like America to me."
Seth Meyers,"Today was Manatee Appreciation Day, unfortunately at Red Lobster."
Seth Meyers,Let me just say that ‘Joe Buden’ would be good nickname for Biden if he started smoking weed to appeal to young voters.
Seth Meyers,"How do you get the current President’s name wrong when you’re running against him? There are places where, if you get that answer wrong, you spend the rest of the night strapped to a gurney."
Jimmy Fallon,It’s like if Mike Pence was selling copies of 50 Shades of Grey .
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night, someone at a liquor store in New Jersey bought the only winning ticket for the Mega Millions jackpot. It’s odd when you walk into a liquor store on a Tuesday and make a good decision."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yup, there’s a new billionaire in New Jersey. I have a feeling you’re going to be able to see that pinkie ring from space."
