Jimmy Kimmel,"There are 265 new [billionaires], including Magic Johnson and Taylor Swift. I guess that MAGA boycott of Taylor Swift is going just great, huh?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump checked in with a net worth of 2.3 billion dollars. Well, somebody’s gonna be spanking himself with a Forbes magazine tonight, I tell you that."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I love that he’s somehow the Christian candidate. Not only does he not go to church, he didn’t even go to church on Easter Sunday… While the Bidens were reading the Bible, Trump was out selling them."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Finally, a Christian holiday we can celebrate."
Jimmy Kimmel,"And then, at 3:02 in the morning, lotta dumps happened."
Jimmy Kimmel,Somehow the ghost of Nikki Haley continues to plague Trump like an undigested chalupa.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Here’s what you should be paying attention to. His longtime former lawyer Michael Cohen says, ‘Donald’s an idiot.’ His former Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, ‘I think he’s unfit for office.’ His other former Defense Secretary (James Mathis) says he’s “the first President in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people… Instead he tries to divide us.’ Former Chief of Staff John Kelly says Trump “has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.’ His former Attorney General Bill Barr suggests that, “Trump shouldn’t be anywhere near the Oval Office.’ His former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, “His understanding of global and U.S. history is really limited.’ Can we get some music to speed this up, because there’s more. Former National Security Adviser (H.R. McMaster) said he showed, ‘the absence of leadership.’ Another former National Security Advisor (John Bolton) said ‘foreign leaders think he is a laughing fool.’ His former Communications Director (Anthony Scaramucci) called him, ‘the domestic terrorist of the 21st century.’ His former Press Secretary (Stephanie Grisham) said, “I am terrified of him running in 2024.’ His former Homeland Security Adviser (Tom Bossert)—‘an utter disgrace.’ Former White House Aide (Cassidy Hutchinson)—“the most grave threat we will face in our democracy in our lifetime, and potentially American history.’ And his former golf trip sex partner (Stormy Daniels) said he has a ‘d**k like the mushroom character in Mario Kart.’ jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"This sounds like a fake project Trump would have given Mike Pence to keep him busy. ‘Mike, you’re in charge of all the moon-clocks, okay?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Forbes released its annual world billionaires list, with one editor calling 2024, ‘an amazing year for rich people.’ Another one? That makes 300,000 years in a row. Congrats guys! I would use some of that money to buy a very strong door and a deep moat because they will eventually come for you if you keep this s**t up."
Stephen Colbert,"All in all, there are more billionaires than ever, even though 32 billionaires died. Because even for billionaires, the only things certain in life are death and… actually just death."
Stephen Colbert,"And you can see plenty of Christians in my my rock and Roll Bible, featuring the Constitution and all the lyrics for Ted Nugent’s deeply moving religious anthem, “Whang Dang… Sweet Poontang."
Stephen Colbert,"[Trump voice] “They’re climbing through your windows, they’re leaping out of their slimy eggs, latching onto your fellow astronauts’ faces, and then in the middle of dinner an anchor baby bursts through John Hurt’s stomach and hides somewhere on the ship, and everybody starts getting killed until Sigourney Weaver saves the day in her teeny-tiny underpants. Then they really lose the thread of the story in Covenant , what’s Danny McBride doing there?” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"Pretty bold to go to a state you lost and tell the crowd you actually won. That’s like bumping into your ex and saying, ‘Amanda, hi. You look well—which of course I know because it came out that we’re still together. We’re still together… by a lot."
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, lotta dumps. So just a regular night for Donald Trump."
Stephen Colbert,You gotta really piss off New Yorkers to get them to vote for a guy from New Jersey who shut down the George Washington Bridge.
Stephen Colbert,"I’m guessing Trump also lost (NY primary) votes to Curbside Oil-and-Urine Puddle, Pile of Rats Mating in an Outdoor Dining Shed, and Eric Adams."
Stephen Colbert,"The moon is getting its own time zone because NASA needs a time-keeping benchmark for lunar spacecraft and satellites that require extreme precision for their missions. But it’s also gonna be great for anyone who needs an excuse to day-drink. ‘Hey, its moon o’clock somewhere!'"
Desi Lydic,"Now, you wouldn’t think that Easter falling on a holiday that’s been on March 31 for 15 years would be that big of a deal. But conservatives processed this like a child meeting the Easter Bunny—by losing their f**king minds."
Desi Lydic,"Uh, this is America, buddy. Every day is Christian Visibility Day."
Desi Lydic,"There’s a false premise at the heart of this entire controversy, which is that there’s even a conflict between trans people and Christianity to begin with. There isn’t. In fact, the Bible doesn’t say anything about trans people. It does, however, say to love thy neighbor, and to not judge other people, and, perhaps the most famous of Bible verses, ‘Please do not sell me for $59.99 to pay off your rape fine.'” desi lydic"
Desi Lydic,"Yes, by total coincidence, Trans Visibility Day happened to fall on Easter this year. Which seemed like, I don’t know, a good fit to me. I mean, Jesus did identify as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, so live your truth, Queen!"
Seth Meyers,"Former President Trump yesterday criticized President Biden for proclaiming Easter Sunday Transgender Day of Visibility and said, ‘it’s a total disrespect for Christians.’ And if you’re gonna disrespect Christians, you might as well make some money off it."
Seth Meyers,"At his rally yesterday in Michigan, former President Trump said, ‘I do great with the suburban housewives.’ In fact, he recently found out that was his most viewed category."
Seth Meyers,We were headed for an economic boom when you left office? He’s doing that thing again where he pretends the last year of his presidency didn’t happen. Like a Bill Cosby biography that ends in 2014.
Seth Meyers,"Three years ago was April, 2021, right? Joe Biden was in the White House, you were moping around your chintzy swamp castle full of plastic surgeons and their third wives, looking paler than the boxes of classified documents you had stored in your bathroom."
Seth Meyers,"Do you know angry someone has to be to leave their home, go to their local poling place, and stand in line just to submit a blank ballot? That’s like driving to your local Apple Store, waiting all day for the new Vision Pro and then, when you get to the counter, screaming, ‘I don’t want these! I think these look stupid!"
Seth Meyers,"Officials in Kyle, Texas recently announced that the city is attempting to set the Guinness world record for the largest gathering of people named Kyle. Which would overtake the current record-holder, any Dave Matthews concert."
Seth Meyers,"In honor of next week’s total solar eclipse, Krispy Kreme will offer a glazed donut that is dipped in black chocolate icing and topped with sprinkles, buttercream frosting and an Oreo. And after a dozen of those, you’ll also block out the sun."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump said he’ll debate, ‘Anytime, anywhere, any place.’ Biden was like, ‘Tell me you’re unemployed without telling me you’re unemployed."
Jimmy Fallon,"Elon Musk just appointed two new employees to oversee safety on his platform, X. So if you’re worried about safety on a platform with half a billion users, don’t worry, they’ve hired two people to handle it."
