Jimmy Kimmel,"In New York, the judge rejected [Trump’s] attempt to delay the Stormy Daniels case. Trump tried to argue presidential immunity. The judge ruled, ‘Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a president’s official acts.’ Which, I’m pretty sure, and I’m not a presidential historian, but I’m pretty sure is the first time a judge has ever had to say that."
Jimmy Kimmel,That trial will start on April 15. April 15 is gonna be a big day for Donald Trump. It’s the first time in history a former president will be held accountable for cheating on his taxes and his wife on the same day.
Jimmy Kimmel,"We also learned in the Florida case that Trump kept classified documents in a variety of locations. Not only did he have them at Mar-a-Lago, he had them at his house in New Jersey, he had them at Trump Tower in New York, he had them on his plane, he had them in Eric’s bouncy house, in the envelopes for the birthdays cards he never sent to Don Jr., under his My Pillow…"
Jimmy Kimmel,"There’s only three possible explanations for this. A—Donald Trump is a bottomless scumbag who would lie about anything to make himself look like a hero. B—His brain has turned to oatmeal so lumpy he can’t distinguish a story he flipped by in the Post from a conversation he had with a grieving loved one. Or, C—Both of the above.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The best part is, it’s a criminal trial, so Trump has to be there every day. Starting April 15, we get to see Donald Trump having to see Stormy Daniels testify about having to see Donald Trump naked. ‘Your honor, for reasons that will soon become all too apparent following her testimony, I’d like to submit into evidence this baby bella mushroom."
Stephen Colbert,"Always a bad sign when your campaign strategy is to bully individual states. ‘Hey, more like Old Hampshire, you dusty bitch.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Well, I don’t know if you’ve noticed but, thanks to Trump, our politics are getting just a tad heated. In fact, [a poll] found that one in five Americans think violence may solve U.S. divisions. When reached for comment, one in five Americans said, ‘You wanna go brah?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Personally, I, Stephen Colbert, stand with the majority, the four out of five Americans who choose non-violence. And I proudly say, ‘Four-on-one? We can take these guys. Go get daddy’s bat!'"
Stephen Colbert,"Really, who are those 18 percent of Independents? ‘I don’t really feel strongly committed to any ideology, but I am willing to kill for… whatevs.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise."

Desi Lydic,The presidential race: It’s the reason your therapist drives a Porsche.
Seth Meyers,"So the company lost $58 million and more than half of its users and yet when it went public, it was first valued at more than $7 billion. I’m sure you’re asking how is that possible. Well, there’s an actually perfectly reasonable explanation but it involves a lot of complex financial jargon and some very technical, obscure macroeconomic principles that will take me a long time to explain. So just do your best to follow along. You ready? The stock market is bulls**t.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"The only way Trump would admit that the money wasn’t real, was if Rudy asked Trump to pay his outstanding legal bills."
Seth Meyers,"He basically lost the entirety of Taylor Swift’s net worth. And by the way, she got that money. Thats not theoretical—she could buy private jets with her debit card."
Seth Meyers,"At Trump fundraiser this week in Palm Beach, organizers are offering attendees the opportunity to sit at former President Trump’s table during dinner if they donate more than 824 thousand dollars. And while it’s a lot of money, it’s still Eric’s only chance."
Seth Meyers,"A Florida man was recently charged with reckless driving after he allegedly put his car in cruise control and stood up through the vehicle’s sun roof. Aw, c’mon, it’s Florida. I’m surprised they don’t have a lane for that."
Jimmy Fallon,"A town in California was on edge when someone reported a mountain lion sighting on their Ring camera. But it turned out to be a ‘hefty house cat.’ That poor cat was like, ‘This… is… mortifying.'"
