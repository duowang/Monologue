Jon Stewart,Or… they could just wait ’til nighttime.
Jon Stewart,Is there nothing that Fox can’t tie to immigration? ‘This year’s cicada infestation provides perfect cover… for Venezuelans.'
Jon Stewart,"Is this sh*t really how God works? ‘I must let man know to repent their wickedness.’ ‘How, Lord?’ ‘Welll, I don’t know, dim the lights for like four minutes?’ ‘And, God, what else?’ ‘Give New Jersey a little shake?'"
Jon Stewart,Weaponizing food in Ukraine is not kosher. Nor Halal. Sorry if I’m bot-sides-ing this.
Jon Stewart,"Every time America tells the world that there’s something we won’t allow, Israel seems to say, ‘Challenge accepted.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, oh yes, immigrants in dark clothing are using the eclipse to try and sneak across the border. They won’t get another opportunity like that until… night."
Stephen Colbert,"As beautiful and otherworldly as eclipses are, there is a simple scientific explanation. For a brief moment the dread god Telebreon devours Mother Moon to punish gentle Tala-Oth the Man Within. That’s why we ring the bell of noontime darkness to frighten Telebreon back into the Horn of Dusk. I learned all that from Neil deGrasse Tyson."
Stephen Colbert,"I think we’ll all remember where we were when we said, ‘What’s that sound? Is my neighbor making a smoothie?'"
Stephen Colbert,The eclipse caused zoo animals to do the unthinkable—anything.
Stephen Colbert,That is a hell of a campaign message: ‘I will bring darkness upon the Earth!'
Stephen Colbert,"His campaign claimed he raised an eye-popping $50 million. Wow, that is impressive.. or not, because so far the amount has not been verified."
Stephen Colbert,"That has big ‘My girlfriend at summer camp is so hot’ energy. ‘Yeah, uh, me and Brenda, we kissed the French way, so it’s so sexy, you can’t verify it. And, and then she gave me 50 million dollars.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Naturally he got real racist about immigrants, saying, ‘Why can’t we allow people to come in from nice countries… you know, like Denmark.’ Maybe because people don’t tend to flee one of the happiest countries on Earth. ‘Astrid, we have to get out of Copenhagen, the furniture design is too functional.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"If you’re excited about the eclipse and the sky turning totally black, wait ’til you hear about nighttime."
Jimmy Kimmel,It was kind of nice to see people lined up at drugstores again for something other than toilet paper.
Jimmy Kimmel,We will save America by plunging it into complete and total darkness!
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump handles an eclipse the same way he handles a porn star, unprotected."
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s right, you didn’t know there are baby firing squads going around?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"UFO is now a UAP, and an STD is an STI. If you come in contact with either one of them, call the Space Force immediately."
Seth Meyers,"strong signs” God was warning Americans to repent] “‘Strong signs?’ it was a 4.8. If that’s a sign, then the F train has been telling us to repent for years."
Seth Meyers,"There is no way Donald Trump has ever turned down millions of dollars in his life. If you tied a five dollar bill to a Roomba and let it loose in Mar-a-Lago, it would keep him preoccupied for the rest of his life. Also, he’d get stuck in a corner."
Seth Meyers,"While speaking at his Palm Beach fundraiser over the weekend, former President Trump complained that immigrants aren’t coming to the U.S. from ‘nice countries’ like Denmark, Switzerland, or Norway. And then way too late added, ‘Or Slovenia!’"
Seth Meyers,"South Carolina Senator Tim Scott on Friday launched a new show co-hosted by four other Black Republicans. Sorry, with the four other Black Republicans."
Seth Meyers,"Former President Trump has apparently told people in private that he could end the war in Ukraine by pressuring the Ukrainians to give up territory to Russia. Ah yes, the guy who still claims he won in 2020 wants someone else to give up."
Jimmy Fallon,"After Friday’s earthquake, everyone asked, ‘Did you feel it?’ After today’s eclipse, everyone asked, ‘Did you see it?’ Which is better than the usual question in New York, ‘Did I sit in that?'"
