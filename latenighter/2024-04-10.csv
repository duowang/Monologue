Stephen Colbert,Trump’s lawyers argued that the former President couldn’t get a fair trial because the jury pool has been polluted by news coverage of Trump’s other recent cases. So are you saying members of the jury can’t have seen any news about Donald Trump’s crimes? His crimes are the news.
Stephen Colbert,"Who would that possibly leave? ‘Your honor, it is only fair that our client be judged by an impartial jury who know nothing about the events in America over the last nine years. Might I recommend 12 confused men who were dropped off in a forest as infants and then raised by wolves? Or could we acquire some clone babies that has have been rapidly aged in some sort of machine and then released into the jury box? Oh, they think he’s guilty, too?'” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"Now if you told Stephen Colbert as a teenager that one day the President of the United States would be standing trial for paying off a porn star, that young man would say, ‘You have porn?'"
Stephen Colbert,"An appeals court judge rejected Trump’s effort to delay his hush money trial as he appeals the gag order. Of course the hush money trial is about having sex, so when the witness testimony starts we’ll be the ones gagging."
Stephen Colbert,"Trump’s change of venue request wasn’t the only desperate stunt he pulled. He also tried suing the judge. Yes it’s bizarro court—the defendant is suing the judge, the Bible’s swearing on the plaintiff, and the gavel is banging everyone."
Stephen Colbert,"And because of the high-profile names in this case, the judge is also asking jurors to disclose their media diet. Okay, that’s all media, including porn. So they’ll need to know if jurors have seen Operation Desert Stormy , The Witches of Breastwick , and Home Alone 2 ."
Stephen Colbert,"‘Let me remind you you’re under oath, Oathkeepers. And you’re under boogaloo, boys.'"
Stephen Colbert,"It’s been two weeks since Truth Social went public and, as of this morning, the company has lost a third of its value and is now trading at its lowest level since its trading debut. It’s a phenomenon that legendary economist John Maynard Keynes once called [slide whistle] [fart noise]."
Stephen Colbert,"Turns out, Victorias Secret? She tore a dude’s throat out."
Seth Meyers,Lawyers for former President Trump filed an appeal yesterday in his hush money case and asked to move the trial out of Manhattan because of possible jury bias. You were President! The whole country has a bias. The only way you’re getting a juror who doesn’t know you is if it’s randomly Tiffany.
Seth Meyers,"President Biden introduced a plan yesterday to reduce student loan debt for over 25 million borrowers. And in typical Democratic fashion, he did it during the eclipse. When are you going to announce universal health care, 11:59 on New Year’s Eve?"
Seth Meyers,"President Biden attacked former President Trump over his stance on abortion, which Trump describes as, ‘Don’t ask, don’t tell.'"
Seth Meyers,"According to a new survey, half of Americans consider their car to be part of the family, while the other half do know what words mean."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It sounds like something out of an episode of Seinfeld . ‘Theres a gag order in the hush money trial? Can you gag a hush?’ ‘Oh, you can gag a hush for sure.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s doing everything he can to delay this hush money trial. Which is what innocent people do, right?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I wish I could get in on questioning these potential jurors. I feel like I’d be so good at it. ‘And one final question sir, does your truck have nutz?"
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump believes that every woman should have the right to drive 600 miles for healthcare.
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s like wrestling but with guys, if you saw them in their underpants, you would throw up."
Jimmy Fallon,"It asks questions like whether they believe in QAnon, use Truth Social, or attend Trump rallies. In other words he wants to know, ‘Are you Marjorie Taylor Greene?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"[The judge] could ask potential jurors as many as 42 questions, or, if you’re wearing antlers, zero."
Jimmy Fallon,"All the networks want to air a Biden-Trump debate. On NBC, they would present it as Law & Order SVU: AARP . On ABC, they would presnt it as The Golden Bachelors Tell All . And on CBS, they would present the debate as Super Old Sheldons ."
Michael Kosta,"Interesting that they call this student debt ‘forgiveness.’ As though the student did something wrong. ‘We forgive you for being a poor, broke bitch.'"
Michael Kosta,Now some critics are saying that this student loan forgiveness is just a cynical bribe by Joe to give young people what they want so they vote for him. And they’re right—it’s an ancient tactic called politics.
Michael Kosta,When people across the country came together to have their wallets stolen while they were distracted by space.
Michael Kosta,"my eyes hurt”] “Back in the day, if you had eye pain you’d call up your family doctor and he’d tell you to smoke more cigarettes. Nowadays you have to wait six weeks to get an appointment with your eye doctor, or you can go online and immediately find out that the eclipse glasses gave you autism."
