Stephen Colbert,"It is April 10, 2024. Unless you like in Arizona, where its 1864, pardner."
Stephen Colbert,"That is crazy. But remember its Arizona, so its a dry crazy."
Stephen Colbert,"It’s a law so old that it was passed before women had the right to vote. To which the Supreme Court said, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll work on that one next.'"
Stephen Colbert,"This law is so old that it predates the invention of the cowboy hat, the urinal, the paper clip, and the machine that makes paper bags. Should we really be enforcing laws from an era where the cutting edge tech was ‘bag?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Since the Dobbs ruling, this issue has been a disaster for all the Republican attempts to keep suburban women voters. So now GOP candidates are backpedaling like a tweaked-out unicycle chimp."
Stephen Colbert,"Over the last 25 years [Trump’s] position on abortion has shifted over 13 times. [Trump voice, while pulling petals off a daisy] ‘I’m pro-choice, I’m pro-choice not.. you know flower, you kind of look like a pretty lady with white hair spiked up there. You wanna make 130 thousand dollars?'"
Stephen Colbert,"You can’t enforce state laws from before it was a state. If you could, people from Massachusetts would be arrested for failure to buckle hat."
Stephen Colbert,"The first order of business is jury selection. Reportedly, Trump’s lawyers want a jury that includes public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Well sanitation workers make sense. They’re gonna want jurors who are comfortable with giant sacks of garbage."
Stephen Colbert,"Damn straight, my audience is perfect to decide this case. It’s all in our new slogan, “ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert : Guaranteed to get you jury duty!'"
Stephen Colbert,"Two Jeremy Rosenbergs in New York City? What are the odds? Oh, and I’m being told ‘very good.’ That was my researcher, Jeremy Rosenberg."
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, but that’s probably on Rosenberg’s [lawyers]. If you’re dialing Trump’s lawyers, you have to dial the county code for Russia first."
Stephen Colbert,"Watch out Jeremy, you don’t want to piss off Donald Trump. He will send a squad of goons to rough up… someone with your name."
Stephen Colbert,"Its official—women’s basketball, now your basketball. Everyone else is playing boysketball."
Michael Kosta,"As we all know, there’s an ongoing battle in America about who should decide on abortion. Should it be women? Should it be Congress? Well, today Arizona is saying, ‘How about men from the Civil War era?'"
Michael Kosta,"This guy has truly been all over the place on abortion. I feel like his positions change based on which of his kids he saw last. Ivanka? Ehh, pro-life. Eric and Don? Mandatory abortion."
Michael Kosta,"C’mon dude, Democrats don’t execute babies after birth. They send them to Hillary so she can harvest their organs."
Michael Kosta,"Also, not the main point here, but that’s more spray tan than usual, right? Your first thought when you see someone’s face should never be, ‘Is it cake?'"
Michael Kosta,"We’ve had no shortage of reminders lately about the Supreem Court’s shift ot the right. They overturned Roe. They killed affirmative action. Last summer they issued that ruling that just said, ‘No homo.'"
Seth Meyers,1864? Was anybody even there yet? Was this their first law after ‘Don’t shoot the piano player?'
Seth Meyers,"And I get that it’s confusing. I mean, he’s says that he’s pro-life but he definitely seems like a guy who’s paid for an abortion, or at the very least told a woman he would go halvsies."
Seth Meyers,"Voters even rejected and anti-abortion measure in Kentucky, which is so conservative their state bird comes in a bucket."
Seth Meyers,"Just to give you an idea of how insane this is, this law dates back to the Civil War. Before women had the right to vote, before the 13th Amendment outlawed slavery, before Arizona was a state, and when Abraham Lincoln was still President. To put that in Lincoln terms, this law is eight-score old. And it was Lincoln himself who said, ‘Anything higher than four-score is too many f**king score.'"
Seth Meyers,"She cited the exact law—by name—in question and now she’s trying to pretend she opposes it. ‘No, no, no I didn’t mean that ARS 13-3603, I meant the other ARS 13-3603, the one that makes it illegal to do a Zoom interview without 13 ring lights pointed directly at your face.'"
Seth Meyers,"Former House Speaker Nacy Pelosi yesterday criticized former President Trump’s announcement that he does not support a national abortion ban and said, ‘He’s either is stupid or he thinks the rest fo us are stupid.’ Oh lady, it’s both. That’s like saying, ‘Either he’s guilty or he has bad lawyers.’ Two things can be true."
Seth Meyers,"I can’t wait to see what he’s like on the stand. ‘Did you pay hush money to a porn star?’ ‘If I did it would be legal.’ ‘Did you pay hush money to a porn star?’ ‘If that happened it would have been fine.’ ‘Did you pay hush money to a porn star?’ ‘Yes, because I was afraid she’d tell everyone I have a weird penis!'"
Seth Meyers,"The NFL announced yesterday that players can choose from 12 new helmet designs next season. Unfortunately, some will get stuck with this one. [Picture of a NY Jets helmet] Yeahh! Off-season Jets burn!"
Jimmy Fallon,"Theres a new viral health trend on [TikTok] where people are walking backwards to improve their joints. And if you love moving backwards, may I suggest Arizona."
Jimmy Fallon,"You never want to hear your teacher say, ‘Kids, sharpen your baloney and get ready for your pop quiz.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"I’m especially looking forward to Ryan Goslings big musical number, ‘I’m just Baltic Avenue."
Jimmy Fallon,It’s a movie about a real estate developer who gets involved in hotels and beauty contests before landing in jail… [audience laughter]… You beat me to it. “ jimmy fallon
Jimmy Kimmel,Five major networks are working on a joint letter to both candidates [urging them to debate]. They said the letter is not finished because they’re waiting for more networks to sign on. And it’s taking a while because no one at Newsmax knows how to read or write.
Jimmy Kimmel,"[On Trump’s photo op offering to buy fast food shakes for an entire restaurant] “After Trump placed the order, the cashier said, ‘Uh, we’re gonna need to see the money first.’ jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Of course the cherry tree is the basis for one of our nation’s most cherished untrue stories, about a young George Washington who used his new hatchet to chop down his father’s cherry tree. And then when his father asked did you do this, he replied, ‘No, it was a total witch hunt.'"
