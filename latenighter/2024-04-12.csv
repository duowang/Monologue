Michael Kosta,"That’s weird. You guys say you don’t want an insane abortion ban, but then you voted to keep it. It’s almost like you’re just totally full of sh*t."
Michael Kosta,"Wow, Kari Lake didn’t just support this bill, she knew its bill number by heart. ‘I believe it’s, uh, ARS 13-3603?’ She said that like when a guy tries to play it cool about how much he’s into Dune , y’know? ‘Oh yeah, I think I’ve heard of that movie… I believe that’s the one where Paul Atreides wields the power of the Bene Gesserit to fulfill the prophecy of the Lisan al Gaib?’"

Yeah—you’ve got back pain? Put some leeches on it. Migraine? More leeches. Feeling depressed? You can see a therapist. Your therapist… is a leech."
Michael Kosta,it’s not the worst thing in the world
Jimmy Kimmel,President Biden condemned the decision. He said he wasn’t in favor of this law when they passed it back in 1864 and he’s not a fan of it now.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He does this in every trial—to gum up the mechanism he keeps challenging and challenging. And it works. All his trials are now behind schedule and most won’t take place until after the election, if at all. Which, I don’t know, sounds like quite a lot of due process for a witch hunt to me."
Jimmy Kimmel,The porn star hush money trial starts Monday. All his many last-minute efforts to delay it have failed. His only move left is to have sex with everyone in the courtroom and pay them $130 thousand to keep their mouth shut.

Seth Meyers,"$230 thousand a day! For comparison’s sake, you could get a pristine, 1967 Chevy Corvette with original transmission and teal blue interior for roughly the same price. Which is perfect, because that’s Joe Biden’s favorite car… Every day that Trump drops that much money on lawyers, he should have to hear Joe Biden say the words, ‘Vroom-vroom, motherf**ker.'"
