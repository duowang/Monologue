Stephen Colbert,"One of the possible jurors who made it through the vetting yesterday said his radio habits included ‘listening to whatever was on while he was in the shower.’ But after he hears details of Trump’s sex life, I’m guessing he’ll be listening to a toaster in the bathtub."
Stephen Colbert,But he’s got thick skin. He’s basically a hunk of beef jerky with layer of bronzer.
Stephen Colbert,"I wouldn’t blame them. After all, the job description reads, Wanted: impartial juror, 4 days a week, $40/day. Benefits include free wi-fi and unlimited death threats."
Stephen Colbert,"As we watch the proceedings we are reminded that, while the wheels of justice may turn slowly, a panel of impartial citizen jurors will do the indispensable public service of listening to testimony about Donald Trump’s mushroom dong."
Stephen Colbert,"Thats gotta be disappointing for Trump, because he really wanted to be down there in Washington with the justices that he appointed. ‘Hey Gorsuch, [draws finger over throat] I’m just saying that your neck looks really itchy. And my finger is a knife and my neck is your neck.'"
Stephen Colbert,"I don’t blame him for wanting someone else to do that. ‘Son, you know how right after you were born, I cheated on your mom with a porn star? Oh, you didn’t know that? You wanna be on my jury?'"
Stephen Colbert,What? No Wednesdays? There’s no possible better day for a porn star trial than hump day!
Stephen Colbert,"Yesterday, Trump fell asleep during the proceedings. He took a little white power nap. But today, he was sharp, focused… and he fell asleep again."
Stephen Colbert,"Well, I think we found the new mascot for Celestial Seasonings Sleepycrime Tea."
Stephen Colbert,"In a totally unrelated story, there’s a national Adderall shortage."
Stephen Colbert,"It is Day 2 of Donald Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial, what many are calling the trial of what feels like a century."
Stephen Colbert,Okay that crowd is… whelming.
Unknown,So people who think about their dogs too much get dismissed? A jury with no white people? How is that fair to Trump?
Unknown,"Before we get into Trump’s trial, let’s be clear about which trial this is. Is it the classified documents trial? No. The January 6 trial? No.The Georgia RICO trial? No. The sexual assault/defamation trial? No. The real estate trial? No. It’s the porn-money-love-sex-music trial."
Unknown,"Now to be clear, Trump is not on trial for sleeping with the porn star or paying her hush money. He’s on trial because he allegedly falsified business documents to cover up the hush money which could be construed as an unreported campaign expense. [Deep breath] This is the most complicated plot a porn star has ever been involved in."
Unknown,You want someone to explain to your son for you why you cant be at his graduation? Pick me! Pick me!
Jimmy Kimmel,"Can you imagine having all your old social media posts about Trump read aloud while he is sitting right in front of you? It might be my version of heaven, but…"
Jimmy Kimmel,"One potential juror was an older woman who said she believed that no one was above the law. And Trump’s lawyers were like, ‘Get her out of here right now.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"And the truth is, paying a woman to keep her quiet about having sex with you while your wife is at home with your newborn baby isn’t illegal. What’s illegal is falsifying records to make it a business expense, which he made so his supporters wouldn’t find out he’s a lying, cheating scumbag. But the joke is on Trump because it turns out his supporters don’t care that he’s a lying, cheating scumbag. He could have saved himself a whole trial and 130 grand.” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"error in paperwork”] “What, you never accidentally forgot to check a box, or keep your pants on when a porn star comes to your hotel room?"
Jimmy Kimmel,Donald Trump is about as bummed out about potentially missing this high school graduation as he was about missing Vietnam.
Jimmy Kimmel,The Trump campaign also pushed back on reports that he fell asleep in court yesterday. He said that was fake snooze.
Jordan Klepper,"We’ve got so much to talk about tonight. Everybody’s trying to get out of the Trump trial, Jordan Klepper is at the courthouse, and John Leguizamo will tell politicians how to round up Latinos. Oh, but not like that. No, no, no, no, no, not like that."
