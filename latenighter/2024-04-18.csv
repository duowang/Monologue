Jimmy Kimmel,"That must be why they asked me to host the show again next year. Which I wasn’t planning to do, but now I might. Maybe you can watch it on the TV in the rec room at Rikers."

All run by a guy who exclusively calls you, ‘big boss.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Specifically, Trump chose to stop by Sanaa Convenient Store because it been the site of a violent attack that resulted in public criticism of the district attorney now prosecuting him.
