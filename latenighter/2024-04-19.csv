Unknown,"He’s talking about you! You’re the media! This reporter just put her entire LinkedIn page on the screen… The call is coming from inside the newsroom, girl."
Unknown,It’s 2024! That’s enough information to track down anybody. I once found a guy based on the shape of a cloud in the background of his IG story.
Unknown,"This lady has the strongest Karen energy I have ever seen. Last time I saw a white lady that pissed off about a bill, she was getting kicked out of a Chili’s."
Unknown,"I don’t know if she’s gonna get Mike Johnson fired, but she’s definitely gonna get store credit for something."
Unknown,"The House is all about having representation, and she certainly is representing all the moms out there who have assaulted a kid’s soccer coach."
Unknown,"This woman is like one of those friends who complains about a boyfriend but it just makes her sound bad. Like, ‘Can you believe Mark cancelled dinner with me just to visit his mom in hospice?'"
Unknown,"Damn. Donald Trump is shaking down the candidates in his own party? For a cut of their money? Oh, this is some straight-up Mafia sh*t. Trump’s about to leave a horse head in someone’s bed. Or even scarier, Rudy Giuliani."
Unknown,"Do you know how crazy this is? Usually candidates in the same political party campaign together, because they have a shared vision for the country. Trump is like, ‘F*ck that, find me on Venmo.'"
Unknown,"Obama was never like, ‘Hope and change. And when I say change, I mean empty your pockets.'"
Unknown,"Can you imagine being at your own wedding and, when the pastor asks if anyone objects, your entire family stands up and goes,’ Please don’t marry this man! We know him better than anyone and he sucks!'"
Stephen Colbert,"A full jury has been picked for Donald Trump’s New York trial, plus one alternate has been seated, too. So 13—also known as a Stormy dozen."
Stephen Colbert,"Remember, when we went to bed last night there were seven confirmed jurors. Then this morning that number went down to six, then down to five. [Singing, to the tune of “100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"
Stephen Colbert,"Oh I love the fly fishing in Manhattan. I mean, I get up at 5 a.m. when the light’s just right. I head out to the large puddle on the corner of 38th and 10th and just… Yesterday I caught a Band-Aid this big."
Stephen Colbert,"This must be [such] comforting news for Trump. ‘Uh, Mr. President, there’s gonna be weeks of humiliating testimony about your sexual infidelity but I wanted you to know you did just win a poll saying you could swallow much more pureed hog anus.'"
Stephen Colbert,medium-sized dog”] “We already know he can dominate a lapdog because I’ve seen him with Lindsey Graham.
Stephen Colbert,"Kinda tells you everything you need to know about this election. ‘Well, I trust Biden with all the tasks that require care and empathy. But, well, but I’m gonna go with the guy who could body slam a poodle through a picnic table.'"
Stephen Colbert,"It’s just Day 3 of the hush money trial from here in New York, New York, the city that never sleeps—unless you’re Donald Trump in a courtroom."
Stephen Colbert,"strikes” to disqualify jurors without cause] “Yes, strikes, famously unlimited. That’s why umpires yell, ‘Strike three! You’re… at the start of beautiful journey."
Stephen Colbert,I think he’s mixing up strikes with unlimited breadsticks.
Stephen Colbert,"While he was in New York, Trump took some time off from the courtroom to pretend to be President again. Because yesterday he met with polish President Andrzej Duda. [Singing, to the tune of “Camptown Races"
Stephen Colbert,"Duda is just the latest in a series of strongmen who have visited Trump recently, earlier this year, Trump met with the right-wing populist president of Argentina, Javier Milei as well as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. And who can forget this very cordial summit with Skeletor and the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein?"
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, that’s either a very unusual story or another one of Biden’s folksy phrases. Like, ‘I guess I woke up on the wrong side of cannibals eating my uncle this morning.’ ‘Well, you know, you cant make an omelette without cannibals eating my uncle.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,if his tongue had been notarized
Jimmy Kimmel,"Being the Speaker of the House nowadays is like being Leonardo DiCaprio’s girlfriend, you hang on for as long as you can. Just try and enjoy the ride."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Mike Johnson. You know, the guy who looks like a kid dressed as an adult for the school play?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"This party is insane, Somehow Mike Johnson, a man who called Planned Parenthood part of an American Holocaust, isn’t right-wing enough for these people. Mike Johnson, a climate change-denying, homophobic religious fanatic, knows that getting Ukraine these weapons is the right thing to do. And even though his party is terrified of Jello Putin-lover Trump, he’s doing it anyway, and that’s why they’re going to destroy him.” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"And we have a new trial of the century—The People of New York vs. Donald Trump. And so far, the people are winning."
Jimmy Kimmel,He hasn’t been that cold since the last time he was in bed with Melania.
Jimmy Kimmel,Those shades aren’t even on the same Sherwin-Williams color palette. He looks like a cantaloupe wearing batting gloves.
Jimmy Kimmel,"There she is, Taylor not too Swift."
