Jon Stewart,So brave. Well done. And I think for this trial we will see the seeds of that introspection bear fruit. Or we will learn that learning curves are for pussies.
Jon Stewart,"He arrived at the intersection of American history. Where he put a quarter in the parking meter of destiny, leaving the car looking to avoid stepping in the urine puddle of jurisprudence."
Jon Stewart,"Are we gonna follow this guy to court every f**king day? Are you trying to make this O.J.? It’s not a chase, he’s commuting."
Jon Stewart,"It’s a sketch. Why would anyone analyze a sketch like it was a… It’d be like looking at The Last Supper and saying, ‘Why do you think Jesus looks so sad here?'"
Jon Stewart,"Look, at some point in this trial something important and revelatory is going to happen, but none of us are going to notice because the hours spent on his speculative facial tics. If the media tries to make us feel like the most mundane bullsh*t is earth-shattering, we won’t believe you when it’s really interesting. It’s your classic Boy Who Cried Wolf Blitzer."
Jon Stewart,"We’ve got a long ways to go here. It’s the first day of the first of his 438 trials to come. Pace yourselves. And if you’re bored, you can always start planning how you’re going to f**k up covering his next trial, and the sober mea culpa you’ll deliver during his next term as President."
Jon Stewart,"Thats right, this is a classic case of The State of New York vs ‘Nuh-Uh.'"
Unknown,"Oh Jon, please, you’re killing me, my poor, sweet, naive older-than-I remember Jon. We need this messy bullsh*t spectacle. Every other news story is a massive bummer. This Trump trial is like an open window in a Greyhound bus full of farts."
Unknown,"This trial is a gift. An extremely gross old man/former President might go to prison for banging a porn star and trying to pay her off and you don’t want us to cover that sh*t all day long? Jon, the first witness is named named David Pecker!"
Unknown,"Here you come with your old-timey, high-falutin’ media critique, ruining our good time just like you ruined the 2012 Daily Show Christmas party."
Jimmy Kimmel,It’s the city that never sleeps vs. the defendant who keeps nodding off during the trial.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s a lawyer and he’s funny, that’s impressive."
Jimmy Kimmel,He and Trump also said there’s nothing wrong with trying to influence an election—and there’s nothing wrong with playing ‘hide the mushroom’ with the star of the movie Hot Showers 6 .
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s like a bank robber going, ‘I went into the bank, I took out money, I came out of the bank with the money—millions of people do that every day, now I’m a criminal?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I could get him to admit that in one second. All you have to do is say, ‘Clearly, Mr. Trump is not attractive, famous, nor wealthy enough to entice such a desirable adult film star.’ He’d jump up on his hands and knees and show you every position they did it in."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It would not be right for me to state that he was, so I cannot, in good conscience, report that Trump was pumping gas like a Barstow Texaco."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Here’s the thing, there’s no way to prove that Donald Trump was the one who dealt it. So please don’t repost this video with a dumb caption like ‘Julius Squeezer,’ or ‘The Shart of the Deal,’ or ‘You have the right to remain silent but deadly.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Because we don’t know if any of this is true, you can’t call him ‘Gasolini.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"And for all the talk Trump does about the media being against him, he has a lot of Peckers out there."
Jimmy Kimmel,300 million? That’s more streams than your uncle with the enlarged prostate.
