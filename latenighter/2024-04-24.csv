Ronny Chieng,"Yeah, $1000? That’s not going to stop Trump from talking, okay. You’ve got to deal with this like any other tantrum. You’ve gotta give Trump an iPad with Cocomelon on it and let him zone out."
Ronny Chieng,"Look, we all know how Donald Trump loves exercise—because of this trial, he’s been morbidly obese for the last 40 years."
Ronny Chieng,"I’ll give Jesse Watters the benefit of the doubt, because I was also kicked in the head by the same horse. But I mean, this is the guy asking to be President of the United States. I mean, thats got to be at least a 40 hour a week gig."
Ronny Chieng,"Yes, it’s very dangerous for people to know Trump’s exact location, which is why he lives in a nondescript building with his name on the front."
Ronny Chieng,"I know the Prime Minster was upset, understandably. But hey, if someone accused my country of being cannibals, I’d just run with it. Like, Don’t f**k with us or we’ll put your d*ck on a kaiser roll."
Jimmy Kimmel,He violated the gag order during the hearing about whether he violated the gag order.
Jimmy Kimmel,"To his credit Blanche fired back. He said, ‘Your Honor, I lost all credibility when I agreed to represent Donald Trump.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,There is literally no difference between Donald Trump and the three men who were murdered by the Klan? Can somebody please put a sock down Newt Gingrich’s throat already.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The one and only witness today was Trump’s old pal and former publisher of the National Enquirer , a guy named David Pecker. Who looks like the man on the Pringles can was now dating your mom."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s World Book Day. Or as the state of Florida calls it, Bonfire Day."
Jimmy Kimmel,His advisors were worried about him going there because a lot of times when an 81-year-old goes to Florida they don’t come back.
Jimmy Kimmel,"As far as I know you don’t pay someone $130,000 not to have sex with you"
Jordan Klepper,"This is a complicated issue about balancing rights. Basically, the prosecution’s argument is that a juror has the right to feel safe while serving on Donald Trump’s jury. While Donald Trump’s argument is that that juror lives at 34 West 52nd Street, and maybe someone should pay that juror a visit and straighten him out."
Jordan Klepper,"I thought Trump was supposed to be young, vigorous candidate in the race. Now when he needs sympathy, suddenly he’s a poor, elderly man crippled by the weight of his own body pulverizing his bones into dust against his chair."
Jordan Klepper,"Are we talking about Donald Trump or an old English sheepdog? ‘You can’t keep him cooped up all day, he needs time outside or he’ll pee on the couch.'"
Jordan Klepper,"Wow! Eight hours a day, four days a week—it’s literally torture. Or, as the rest of the world calls it, a job. A part-time job, to be fair."
Jordan Klepper,Would Trump even want fresh air and exercise? These actually sound the like the punishments the judge would give Trump if he’s convicted.
Jordan Klepper,"The Trump campaign also tells us where he’s going to be at exactly when. They’re called Trump rallies, and it’s how I know where to go to get yelled at."
Jordan Klepper,"Today was the second day of Trump’s hush money trial and the first witness was the editor of the National Enquirer . He testified that, to help Trump win the 2016 election, he would buy scandalous stories about Trump and bury them. And what a good job he did. I can’t think of a single Trump scandal."
Jordan Klepper,"Look, at some point, we all get to an age where we confuse our own life story with the plot of Indiana Jones , it happens."
Jordan Klepper,"Biden apologized to the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister by inviting him to a dinner with Pete Buttigieg, who will be served over rice with a balsamic reduction."
