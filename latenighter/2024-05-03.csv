Seth Meyers,"Can you imagine going back in time and telling yourself ten years ago that an ex-President who staged a coup to stay in power would fall asleep multiple times—and at one point reportedly even pass gas during his criminal trial—not for waging the coup (which is a different trial that we might not even get to) but for paying hush money to a porn star to stop her from telling the world about his weirdly shaped penis, and it wouldn’t be the biggest headline in the newspaper every single day? You’d be like, No way, I’m gonna tell everyone about this on my favorite well-functioning website, Twitter!” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Prosecutors argued today that former President Trump should be sanctioned again for violating his gag order. Apparently, he talks in his sleep."

Seth Meyers,"outside agitators”] “Oh my God, he’s right. That can only mean one thing, the outside agitator is… Kinkos."
Seth Meyers,"He’s right, the story is what’s happening in Gaza. That’s what the protests are about. And always, I will say, I love Bernie’s delivery. It really helps him drive home the point he’s making. He’s like a grandpa reminding everyone to stop texting at dinner."
Seth Meyers,"‘I make tough decisions?’ What are you talking about, the decision to listen to the voices?"
Seth Meyers,"honest”] “Dude, if everything was honest, the only results you’d have to accept would be the results of the prison talent show."
Seth Meyers,"Oh, so that’s what a priest has to do to get arrested."
Seth Meyers,"Honestly, it’s just good to hear his crush was on candy."
Stephen Colbert,"Eventually they’re just going to have to put him on a baby monitor. ‘Oh no, he’s on his stomach again. I gotta go flip him over.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Trump’s lawyers claim that [Michael] Cohen should not be protected under Trump’s gag order because on social media, Cohen has taunted Trump, suggesting his former client cannot control his bowels. Oh sure, laugh all you want… I certainly do."
Stephen Colbert,But Michael Cohen is an adult and it’s not like he came up with some childish nickname for the former President. [Plays clip of Trump’s longtime intimate legal fixer calling him “Von Schitzenpants
Stephen Colbert,"Show some respect sir, thats President Von Schitzenpants."
Stephen Colbert,"We here at Team Late Show have been following the tragic career suicide of South Dakota Governor and Talbot’s mannequin you could swear just blinked, Kristi Noem."
Stephen Colbert,"Noem bragged in her memoir about how she shot her 14-month-old puppy as well as a family goat. And I’ll be honest, I was conflicted about whether or not I should keep talking about it. Because unlike Kristi Noem, I don’t like beating a dead horse."

Jimmy Kimmel,I thing what Cohen was trying to say is that Trump is a well-soiled machine.
Jimmy Kimmel,"They put the worst spin on it? You dragged a 14-month-old puppy to a gravel pit, shot it in the head, and then told everybody. You wrote it in your book—that’s not spinning, that’s reading."
Jimmy Kimmel,"In Arizona, the state senate finally voted to repeal their antiquated abortion law from 1864. Governor Katie Hobbes signed the official paperwork to repeal the law. Once the law goes into effect, abortion in Arizona will be allowed, but only before 15 weeks and with no exceptions for rape or incest. Which is progress from 1864 to 1964, but it’s progress."
Jimmy Kimmel,So congratulations to women in Arizona. Maybe next year they’ll let you drive.
Jimmy Fallon,"A man who caused an emergency landing on a flight from London to New Jersey because he allegedly got drunk and started yelling was just fined $20,000. The most surprising is that he was from London and not New Jersey."
