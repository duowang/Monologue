Jordan Klepper,"Oh, you’ve done it now, Donald. If you violate that gag order for an eleventh time, the judge is really gonna consider jail time. I mean he’s strongly considering the possibility of consequences for your actions!"
Jordan Klepper,"Look, I get that no judge wants to throw a former President into the slammer. But Donald Trump has the mind of a toddler. If there’s one thing a toddler understands, it’s that when mom and dad start counting like, ‘Nine… nine-and-a-half… nine-and-three-quarters…,’ the brat has already won."
Jordan Klepper,"I’m not a political expert, but if I had to give a politician advice, I would say the top thing is not to shoot your puppy. The second top thing would be to not write about shooting your puppy."
Jordan Klepper,"That is not an excuse, Kristi Noem. You can’t just go around executing puppies and say, ‘Well, that’s life on a farm.’ It’s a farm, not international waters."
Jordan Klepper,"Dear lord, this woman has a taste for dog blood! It’s like she thought All Dogs Go to Heaven was a personal challenge."
Jordan Klepper,"And for ‘bad behavior?’ I mean, even Cruella De Vil was like, ‘Jesus, at least I was making a coat!'"
Jordan Klepper,"What did the goat do? It sounds like she saw it and was like, ‘Well, I can’t leave any witnesses.'"
Jordan Klepper,"There’s no way Trump is going to pick Kristi Noem, but he wants to keep her around in case one of the other lapdogs stops obeying his commands."
Seth Meyers,"Please, you think Trump is scared of jail? That place is full of mobsters and white supremacists, he’ll walk into jail like Norm walks into Cheers."
Seth Meyers,"[Also addressing Tim Scott’s refusal to answer] “This is how much you have to humiliate yourself to suck up to Trump. Normal people don’t talk like this. Imagine if your spouse got home late and you said, ‘Where were you?’ And they said, ‘I was at work.’ And you said, ‘But I called work and they said you weren’t there.’ And they said, ‘That is my statement.’ And you said, ‘But where were you?’ And they said, ‘You can ask it multiple times, but at the end of the day, I was at the office.’ And you said, ‘I’m not hearing an answer.’ And they said, ‘I’m looking forward to sleeping! And that is my statement.’ You wouldn’t shrug and say, ‘Well, let’s keep this marriage going for four more years.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Yesterday was Cinco de Mayo, and Kendrick Lamar celebrated with his favorite piñata."
Seth Meyers,Joebi-Wan Kenobi”] “I’m not sure how helpful it is to compare Biden to a ghost.
Seth Meyers,"I don’t know, have you ever watched him walk? He’s definitely more of a C3P-Joe."
Jimmy Fallon,"I mean, if you violate a gag order nine times you might as well make it an even ten."
Jimmy Fallon,‘When it came to your attention?’ You wrote the book!
Jimmy Fallon,"[The Kentucky Derby] was so popular, Netflix is now working on The Roast of Mystic Dan ."
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, no President has ever served jail time. Although Grover Cleveland did spend some time in witness protection as Grover Cincinnati."
Stephen Colbert,Donald Trump could go to Rikers Island. My condolences to whatever prison guard has to conduct the cavity search. Wear a headlamp.
Stephen Colbert,"A jury’s supposed to be of my peers, but I can tell you, from what I can tell, they all love their children. And none of them tagged a porn star at a celebrity golf event."
Stephen Colbert,"He’s picking his Vice President Bachelor -style. ‘I really enjoyed our one-on-one time in the fantasy Oval Office, Marco Rubio. Will you accept this noose?'"
Stephen Colbert,"That’s your ‘if I was President’ fantasy? What happens if she finds a genie’s lamp? ‘Kill a dog, kill a dog, time machine so I can go back and kill’s Hitler…’s dog.'"
Stephen Colbert,"I assume the food options are chicken, fish, and the most dangerous game."
Jimmy Kimmel,God help whoever gets that gig. They might find Vivek Ramaswamy living up there.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Sending the former President on a trip to Bar-a-Lago, according to Judge Merchan, is ‘the last thing I wanna do.’ Which is funny because it’s the first thing I want to do."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He hosted an event at Mar-a-Lago for wealthy donors. It was a luncheon that included about a dozen potential running mates, all of whom are auditioning to be his number two on the exciting new reality competition show, So You Think You Can Pence ."
Jimmy Kimmel,Only Donald Trump could end up with a running mate and cellmate in the same month.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I really love that she thinks she still has a shot. I mean, she had a shot, she used it on her dog."
Jimmy Kimmel,Why would she even claim this? She’s like the female George Santos. Although sometimes George Santos is the female George Santos.
Jimmy Kimmel,Maybe the ghost writer was the ghost of the goat.
