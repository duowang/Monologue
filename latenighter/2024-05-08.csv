Stephen Colbert,"It was an historic day in the annals of American law, because today Stormy Daniels did what she does best, and that’s spank Donald Trump."
Stephen Colbert,"Did you say ‘no time to prepare?’ It did not occur to you or your lawyers that the Stormy Daniels hush money trial might involve an appearance by Stormy Daniels? That’s like a cook at Burger King saying, ‘Oh my God, someone ordered a Whopper!'"
Stephen Colbert,"[It’s] when Trump and Stormy became the celebrity couple, Stumpy. Wait, I’m sorry, I forgot, we’re not supposed to describe his genitalia."
Stephen Colbert,"And then, when dinner ended, Stormy went into the bathroom in Trump’s suite and saw a ‘leathery looking toiletry bag.’ Nope, again, we’re not supposed to describe Trump’s genitalia."
Stephen Colbert,"‘Trump also paid Stormy the ultimate compliment, telling her, ‘You remind me of my daughter.’ [Extended attempt to choke back vomit .] stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Yes, were having trouble falling asleep in the same bed because she snores and I bang porn stars.'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Last night’s theme was The Garden of Time, based on a 1962 short story about elites living in a utopia of leisure, art, and beauty while an encroaching and chaotic mob draws nearer ever hour. A little on the nose, guys. I’m guessing next year’s theme is gonna be, Ah! They’ve Breached the Doors! Quick, Hide Behind the Chagall!” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"It’s all in the new horror movie, Saw: Donald Trump’s Penis ."
Stephen Colbert,inflame the jury”] “And it is dangerous to inflame that this jury. Do you know how much gas Trump has released into that courtroom?
Stephen Colbert,Of course theres a simple explanation. The dogs are in a Kristi Noem protection program.
Seth Meyers,Adult film star Stormy Daniels testified today in President Trump’s hush money trial. So Trump technically slept with her again.
Seth Meyers,One of the prosecutors told Judge Juan Merchan that Daniels would not describe Trump’s genitalia. Because it would violate the gag order.
Seth Meyers,[Stormy Daniels] testified that she spanked Trump with a rolled-up magazine that had his face on the cover. And I think it’s weird that the hotel even had a copy of Bankruptcy Aficionado .
Seth Meyers,"You know what, I think that’s more than enough, because at some point, you know, we’re just piling on. The man was our President, you know what I mean? Who among us hasn’t slept with an adult film star, and then tried to cover it up, and then become President. And yet we look down our noses at him, I don’t think so. Shame on us. Shame on me. [Pause] Adult film star Stormy Daniels testified that she and Trump had sex in missionary position. ‘Don’t even think about it!,’ shouted Judge Merchan to the sketch artist.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"[Stormy Daniels] said that in phone calls after the sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, he would always call her ‘honeybunch.’ ‘Honeybunch.’ And you guys think Biden is too old."
Seth Meyers,"The Biden campaign released a new ad today criticizing President Trump’s immigration record that highlights his family separation policy. In Trump’s defense, he just assumed people wanted to be separated from their family."
Seth Meyers,Putin sailed to victory after his opponent dropped out… of a window.

Jordan Klepper,"Oh come on, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, acting like you’re too good for this. Like you’ve never seen genitalia before, all right? You’re very prudish for people whose names sound like porn names."
Jordan Klepper,"Remember, the court worked hard to find an unbiased jury. Which means there is at least one person on there who was in a coma for the last 10 years. And I bet that guy is losing his mind today."
Jordan Klepper,Oh that poor poor magazine. Hasn’t print media suffered enough?
Jordan Klepper,It’s the magical night when the world’s most fashionable cultural icons try to figure out how the f**k they’re going to fit their spiky headdress into an Uber pool.
Jordan Klepper,"Okay, a dress made of sand is super-impressive. ‘Who are you wearing?’ ‘Coney Island.'"
Jordan Klepper,"So, Trump isn’t just a bad lover who thinks that talking about his daughter is an acceptable form of foreplay. He’s a creep who dangles career advancement over women to get them to have sex with him. Because lord knows they’re not in it for the two minutes of thrusting."
Jordan Klepper,"Who would have thought a man found liable for sexual assault would coerce a woman into sex. I mean honestly, you can’t even trust sex offenders these days."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You see, and that’s when I need to object. Some of us are trying to host a show here."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Feels like we should lock him up just for that, right?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"When [Daniels] raised her right hand, Trump instinctively shouted, ‘I’m a bad boy, mommy!'"
Jimmy Kimmel,The guy who complains everything is rigged offered to rig his stupid show.
Jimmy Kimmel,He also stared directly into an eclipse. Not exactly a ‘safety first’ kind of guy.

Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was like, ‘The hush money was supposed to be my protection.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Today is Teacher Appreciation Day. And I want all the teachers out there to party so hard that tomorrow becomes Substitute Teacher Appreciation Day.
