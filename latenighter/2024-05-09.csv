Jordan Klepper,"It’s so wild that we’ve all been joking about how RFK Jr has brain worms and then he actually has brain worms. It’s like if the weird kid in class came back with a note from the doctor saying, ‘Actually Kyle does have Stage 2 turd face.'"
Jordan Klepper,"What!? I don’t know what’s worse that RFK had a worm that was eating his brain, or that his brain is so poisoned it killed the worm."
Jordan Klepper,"Now, the Kennedy campaign is dismissing the notion that the dead worm in their candidate’s brain could cause any cognitive problems. But the story actually came out because the New York Times found a 2012 deposition from Kennedy’s divorce in which he argued that his earning power had diminished because, ‘I have cognitive problems, clearly.’ So I guess his argument now is, ‘No, no, the worm didn’t eat the president part of my brain, just that part that has to give my ex-wife money.'” jordan klepper"
Jordan Klepper,"I mean, no wonder why RFK cares so much about climate change. He’s legally a thermometer."
Jordan Klepper,"I will say, the last few years I have been wondering how far is too far for the right-wing MAGA crowd. And now we know. It’s shooting your dog in a gravel pit. That is not acceptable—until Trump does it. Then every Republican has to shoot their dog just to stay in the party."
Jordan Klepper,"So kudos right-wing media for putting your foot down against killing dogs. You can hold your head up high and go back to your regularly scheduled segment, ‘Why don’t we toss the migrant kids into the Grand Canyon?'"
Jordan Klepper,"For God’s sake can we talk about something else? I shot a dog once, did you hear about that?"
Seth Meyers,"The New York Times published a report on independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s health issues, including a dead worm in his brain. Or, as that’s known in Libertarian circles, a running mate."
Seth Meyers,"You might remember her as the leading Trump VP contender who, in her book, with her name on it, volunteered the information that she once killed a puppy. Out of nowhere, no one forced it out of her, she sat down at the old Remington and thought, ‘What’s a good yarn for my new book? Something that lets everyone learn what makes Kristi tick? Oh, right! [Typing] Blew dog’s brains out.'"
Seth Meyers,"I’ll admit that my knowledge about farm life begins and ends with with the song about Old MacDonald. But as far as I can remember there wasn’t a verse that ended with, ‘A bang-bang here and a bang-bang there.'"
Seth Meyers,She’s digging the hole so deep she could bury a dog in it.
Seth Meyers,"Yeah, she needs more bad press like she needs a hole in her dog."
Seth Meyers,"Don’t get me wrong, I really don’t want to hear about Donald Trump’s weird penis. But also I kind of want him to have to hear it."
Seth Meyers,Someone reading a description of your weird penis in court sounds like a dream you’d have after eating a Hot Pocket you found on the train.
Seth Meyers,"Look, if you don’t want an adult film star testifying in a trial of a former President, don’t vote for a President who slept with an adult film star. And you might say, ‘I didn’t know he slept with an adult film star before I voted for him.’ And the reason you didn’t is because he paid her off so she wouldn’t tell anyone, and that’s why she’s in court, and that’s the reason. The fact that he’s also humiliated and embarrassed is what’s called, the legal term, a bonus.” seth meyers"

Stephen Colbert,"Cause of death, starvation.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"RFK Jr went to a doctor because he was experiencing some cognitive symptoms like memory loss and fogginess. As well as a tiny voice in his head going, ‘Let’s see, what wine pairs best with cerebellum?'"
Stephen Colbert,"I the deposition, RFK Jr revealed, ‘I have short-term memory loss, and I have longer-term memory loss,’ adding, ‘and I also have short-term memory loss.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Classic divorce court argument. ‘Your Honor, my client is entitled to alimony.’ ‘C’mon Brenda, be reasonable, you know a worm ate my brain!'"
Stephen Colbert,"Well of course, those fish were just jumping in his mouth trying to get the worm."
Stephen Colbert,They were off today so the baliff could refill the courtroom’s Febreze supply.
Stephen Colbert,"Are we sure thats her name and not just how Trump describes her? ‘Okay Todd Glasses does the opening statement, Susan Necklace does the cross, Johnny Bowtie here brings me my Big Mac, and, uh oh, Big Judge Black Mumuu is mad at me again.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Wow. That’s gotta sting for Trump. That’s like a boss telling you, ‘Sorry we’re passing you over for the promotion and giving it to Mark, may he rest in peace.'"

Jimmy Kimmel,"Nikki Haley disappeared at the beginning of March and she still took home over 20 percent of the vote. Which means that either a large chunk of Indiana voters are not planning to vote for Trump, or Mike Pence voted 128 thousand times."
Jimmy Kimmel,"To get an invite, you had to buy all 47 of Trump’s NFTs at 99 bucks a pop. I tell you, I would hate to be his assistant this morning. ‘Sir, a reminder, tonight you have to eat with the freaks who paid $4,700 for pictures of you wearing Superman tights and a cape, okay?'"
Unknown,"Former House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a new interview that he will not vote for former President Trump and will instead write in a better candidate, like that dead worm in Robert Kennedy Jr’s brain."
