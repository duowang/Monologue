Seth Meyers,"smear job”] “First of all, a ‘smear job’ is one of the things Trump paid hush money to cover up."
Seth Meyers,Because in real life you can’t fast forward the scenes where the actors are talking.
Seth Meyers,"Independent Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr posted on X yesterday and said “I offer to eat 5 more brain worms and still beat Donald Trump and President Biden in a debate.’ And this can’t be good, his supporters have already made it a TikTok challenge."
Seth Meyers,"So, let me just go through my list of Kennedy family quotes…"

Seth Meyers,"The streaming services Disney+, Hulu, and Max announced yesterday that they will be available as a bundle. The new service will be called TV. It’s just TV again, guys, I don’t know what to tell you."
Jon Stewart,‘Missionary.’ No wonder Trump has locked up the evangelical voting bloc.
Jon Stewart,"Tell us more.” [Clip of Lawrence O’Donnell saying the phrase, “not wearing a condom"
Jon Stewart,"Look, no disrespect to any of these f**king idiots, but I think we can move household appliances down on the ‘threat to democracy’ list."
Jon Stewart,"They can take our lives, but they can never take our cooktops!"
Jon Stewart,You people are f**king children. That came out wrong.
Jon Stewart,"dead”] “Oh my God, the Boy Scouts are dead! While we were all fixated on the titillating details of the Stormy Daniels testimony, the Boy Scouts all died! I’m assuming in a terrible s’mores explosion engineered by one Joseph Charles Manson Biden!"
Jon Stewart,"Oh, the Boy Scouts are alive. They just rebranded as an organization, partly because they started letting girls in five years ago, and partly because they had a giant molestation scandal… Rebranding is a tried-and-true formula for many organizations. It’s why the Catholic Church now goes by ‘Gary.'"
Jon Stewart,"[In response to one conservative critic in particular] “Okay, I don’t want to break character here or anything, but this motherf**ker… This guy who is blaming the Left for the loss of our institutions where young boys can become strong men, his name is Matt Schlapp. You may remember him. He’s the head of the American Conservative Union. You may remember that as the strong man who was sued—this guy was sued by another fella for non-consensually grabbing his d**k in 2022. Yeah. That only got dropped after a reported $480 thousand settlement. The point being, when this guy talks the depravity of our institutions, he knows of which he speaks.” jon stewart"

Stephen Colbert,"Now, I talked about this yesterday and I was prepared to let dead brain-worms lie. But now RFK Jr has responded and, as you might imagine, his response is not as sharp as it might have been before the worm got snacky."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Team Trump spent much of the day trying to paint Daniels as a sleazy, money-grubbing liar, which, if that is true, you can see why they hit it off."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump’s lawyers are still going with this ‘he didn’t have sex with her’ fairy tale. This is a guy who’s been sued hundreds of times for not playing plumbers, for stiffing dishwashers, painters, waiters, bartenders, even his own lawyers. We’re supposed to believe he handed a 130 thousand dollar check to a porn star for no reason?"
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump’s attorneys finished their cross-examination of Stormy Daniels, and they accused her of lying and hawking merchandise for personal gain. And Trump was like, ‘This also feels like a shot at me, too.'"
