Stephen Colbert,"Trump held a rally this weekend down at the Jersey Shore. And did exactly what you’re supposed to do at the Jersey Shore. Hang out with friends, try to forget your upcoming court date, and never go in the water."
Stephen Colbert,"It all happened in the New Jersey town of Wildwood. Which, if you’ve never been there before, imagine if a bootleg Rick and Morty t-shirt were a place."
Stephen Colbert,"Oh. I love Silence of the Lamb . It’s one of my favorite movie. It’s right up there with Star War , Dances With Wolf , and Jaw ."
Stephen Colbert,"In none of the stories does Hannibal Lecter die, and Sir Anthony Hopkins is still very much alive. Does Trump just think a character dies when he turns off the TV?"
Stephen Colbert,"‘They’re up there with late, great Hannibal Lecter, probably enjoying a nice dinner together. Congratulations, Hannibal, you ate my dad.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Frank Sinatra’s been dead since the late 90s. Was he talking to the late, great Frank Sinatra or directly to an all-beef frank?'"
Stephen Colbert,This is week four in his ‘faking business records to cover up bangin’ a porn star’ trial.
Stephen Colbert,"Coincidentally, ‘not long’ is how Stormy described it."
Stephen Colbert,"But it’s true, he would be off the market soon. I mean, he’s clearly past his expiration date."
Stephen Colbert,"‘Mikey, be warned. You’re going to have to pay Karen, Stormy, Dusty, Misty, Kristi, Krispi, Crunchy, Crinkly, and Grisly—and of course one married woman, Mrs. Butterworth.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Remember, Trump’s whole defense is, ‘I didn’t sleep with Stormy Daniels, and I didn’t pay her to be quiet. Michael Cohen paid her to be quiet, ’cause he’s such a great guy, who I hope is torn apart by wild dogs. And I only paid him what I thought were legal fees, and if I did anything at all I did everything I did, which I didn’t do, to protect my wife from finding out the things I never did.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The lights were so bright they could be seen as far away as Florida, where Governor DeSantis immediately banned the sky for displaying a Pride flag."
Seth Meyers,"Seriously, New York Times . That headline sounds less like a description of a wannabe dictator who’s been indicted four times and more like one of Carrie’s columns in Sex and the City ."
Seth Meyers,"At this rally, Trump talked about The Silence of the Lambs character Hannibal Lecter and said he was “a wonderful man."
Seth Meyers,"I know we take chunks of his speeches and put them in A Closer Look, but is he taking chunks of Closer Looks and just putting them in his speeches now? The whole time I was watching that I was like, ‘Is that a f**king bit we did? ‘The late, great Hannibal Lecter,’ we f**king did that.'"
Seth Meyers,"So if you’re keeping track—though why would you—Springsteen and the District Attorney are bad, but Hannibal Lecter, Scarface, and hot dogs are good."
Seth Meyers,"And can we just agree to leave Jimmy Carter out of this? The man’s 99 years old, has spent his post-presidency being quietly charitable with organizations like Habitat for Humanity. To put it in simpler terms, he’s built more homes than Hannibal Lecter has eaten faces."
Seth Meyers,Just take his name out of your mouth. Which shouldn’t be hard because it’s barely in your brain.
Seth Meyers,"[On Trump unwisely asking, “Can you believe it?” concerning his Frank Sinatra anecdote] “No, I can’t believe it. And here’s why. Because Frank Sinatra died in 1998 and you became a politician in 2015, so that conversation didn’t happen. And what would the context for that anyway? Under what circumstances would Frank Sinatra be talking to Donald Trump and his main advice for Trump—who, again, was neither a politician nor a TV personality when Sinatra was alive—would be, ‘Don’t eat before you perform?'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"‘Not long on the market?’ You’re a 78-year-old psychopath with massive debt. That’s not a market, thats a lost and found bin."
Seth Meyers,"on the market” comment] “So yeah, he wrote his own vows."
Seth Meyers,some guys” might find his affair with a porn star “cool
Seth Meyers,Are you sure you want to be on the show where people guess the price of stuff?
Seth Meyers,A zoo in China has been facing criticism for displaying dogs that were painted to resemble pandas in a panda exhibit. And you could tell right away they weren’t pandas because they were constantly humping.
Seth Meyers,"The Westminster Kennel Club Show began this weekend, despite the best efforts of Kristi Noem."
Jimmy Fallon,"I’m no political expert, but maybe don’t keep saying, ‘the late, great Hannibal Lecter.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump hadn’t been face to face with Michael Cohen since last year. Melania heard and was like, ‘Twinsies!’ jimmy fallon"
Jimmy Fallon,"I’ll never forget what he said to me backstage. He will, but I won’t."
Jimmy Fallon,Which means somewhere there’s a heated negotiation that includes the word ‘wienermobile.'
Jon Stewart,"I don’t mean to get sentimental here, but in what other country in the world can a Cuban-American Senator work hand in hand with an Egyptian-born businessman to corner the halal meat market. [Singing] Livin’ in America…'"
Jon Stewart,These are simply emotional support gold bars.
Jon Stewart,"Yes, it’s those three magic words that every woman is dying to hear, ‘It was her!'"
Jon Stewart,"You motherf**kers. You bury one union leader at your football stadium, while running a human trafficking ring through some Secaucus rabbis, and suddenly your whole state is a suspect."
Jon Stewart,"And if you think it’s because the average U.S. Senator is so smart, this is the average U.S. Senator. Tommy Tuberville, an ex-football coach who doesn’t know the three branches of government."
Jon Stewart,"Oh my God, what timing! You see that? You see, the rest of us only find out about Boeing’s problems as we’re being sucked out of the fuselage, mid-flight."
Jon Stewart,"Holy s**t. Out of all the Senators and Representatives who dodged and prevaricated and who wouldn’t answer any f**king questions, you know you’re in trouble when the most honest and transparent person in a story about government corruption is the ex-crackhead."
