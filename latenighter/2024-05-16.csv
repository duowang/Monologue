Seth Meyers,"President Biden and former President Trump are set to face off in two presidential debates. Biden is looking forward to laying out his 2024 agenda, while Trump is just happy to go somewhere where nobody will draw him while he sleeps."
Seth Meyers,"For some reason Trump thinks it will work to his advantage to debate Joe Biden on national television, despite the fact that when they debated in 2020, it was an embarrassing clusterf**k in which Trump behaved like a coked-up raccoon trapped in a porta-potty at Coachella."
Seth Meyers,The moderator of a nationally televised debate had to yell “No!
Seth Meyers,"It’s really quite something to challenge your opponent to a debate anytime, anywhere, anyplace while you’re standing behind barricades at a mandatory court appearance for your criminal trial. You sure got that much flexibility in your schedule, bro?"
Seth Meyers,Biden getting Trump to agree to no audiences is like getting a vampire to fight you at noon on the beach during the garlic festival.
Seth Meyers,"Also, you’d think a guy facing four separate criminal indictments, attempted a coup, got impeached twice, oversaw a net job loss and a spike in crime, cheated on his wife with a porn star ,and left the nation in crisis after letting a pandemic spiral out of control would want to avoid a debate. Hell, if I so much as did one of those things, I would want to avoid being seen in public again."
Seth Meyers,"But the contrast Biden will benefit from onstage is that he’s normal for his age, and Trump is not normal for any age. Like, what’s a good age for a kid to think Hannibal Lecter is real, dead, and a cool dude?"
Seth Meyers,Michael Cohen yestderday testified that he still lives in a Trump-branded building. Which tells you just how much of a pain in the ass it is to move in New York City.
Seth Meyers,Look at these dorks. They look like a doo-wop group called The Four Treasons. They look like the Men’s Wearhouse softball team. They look like a singing group called MAGA-Pella. It looks like they put Mitt Romney in a cloning machine but something went a little more wrong with each copy.
Stephen Colbert,"These two men last debated back in October of 2020. We all remember gathering with our friends and families on the couch to say, ‘Oh God, I hope this doesn’t happen again in four years.'"
Stephen Colbert,Make my day” challenge with “Let’s get ready to rumble
Stephen Colbert,Imagine Trump with his mic cut. He’s going to look like the world’s angriest mime.
Stephen Colbert,"That’s the kind of soulful musicality that makes dad bands everywhere go, ‘Wait, is that what we look like?'"
Stephen Colbert,"How do they get the dogs to run that fast? Wait, I’m being told one of the judges was Kristi Noem."
Stephen Colbert,"The yacht in question was named the Alboran Cognac, which is the douchiest possible yacht name next to the S.S. The Housekeeper Is Actually Like Family to Us."
Jimmy Fallon,"Biden and Trump will meet June 27 on CNN, and one of Biden’s debate conditions was not having an audience. So that explains why it’s on CNN."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump agreed to the debate. He said, ‘I’ll be there assuming it’s okay with my parole officer.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"The first debate will be next month, which is the earliest a presidential debate has ever been. And if were being honest, an early bird debate feels right for these guys."
Jimmy Fallon,"The Paris Olympics is providing athletes with twin-sized beds that have cardboard frames to keep them from having sex. If they wanted a bed where sex was guaranteed to never happen, they could have used the one from my college dorm."
Jimmy Fallon,"They said all athletes will have [the] beds except the badminton team, which they don’t have to worry about."
Desi Lydic,Trump skipped every primary debate like it was foreplay.
Desi Lydic,"Aw, sh*t! Yeah! Now that’s the Joe Biden I know and moderately like!"
Desi Lydic,Yay! I can’t wait to watch. [Looks through fingers over eyes] Like this.
Desi Lydic,"Oh, I just remembered, I have to buy tampons."
Desi Lydic,"Obviously, this is a pretty big departure from other portraits of the royal family. For example, Queen Elizabeth was often painted with her beloved corgis. Compare that to Charles, who looks like he was painted with her corgis once Kristi Noem was finished with them."
Desi Lydic,"Now clearly this painting has gotten a lot of negative feedback. But King Charles swears that he loves the portrait, which probably means he’s having an affair with another portrait on the side."
