Stephen Colbert,"That’s right, Lauren Boebert was in the audience. So whoever sat next to her might end up with their own hush money trial."
Stephen Colbert,"Gaetz summoned the specter of violence by tweeting a reference to the far-right hate group the Proud Boys: ‘Standing back and standing by, Mr. President.’ Well of course he’s standing back. After all that pizza, you do not want to be in the blast radius."
Stephen Colbert,"Today, Trump’s attorney Todd Blanche pointed out that the call was only one minute and 36 seconds. So only slightly longer than the sex with Stormy."
Stephen Colbert,"As motivation for Cohen’s ‘vindictiveness,’ the defense tried to show that Cohen felt rejected by Trump, including getting him to confirm that he had a hard time getting tickets to Trump’s 2017 inauguration. Wow, that had to sting. Because we all know there were plenty of seats available."
Stephen Colbert,"Yesterday, Mayor Adams announced New York will host its first-ever rat summit this fall. To prepare, the city has been hosting practice rat summits on every subway platform for the last 120 years."
Stephen Colbert,"scam” and a “sham”] “Coincidentally, ‘Scam’ and ‘Sham’ are also the Secret Service code names for Eric and Don Jr."
Jimmy Fallon,"It was another day of former President Trump’s hush money trial. And because of his gag order, a bunch of Republicans showed up at the courthouse and attacked the judge and prosecutors for him. They’re saying by next week Trump will run out supporters and just show up with a ventriloquist dummy."
Jimmy Fallon,"Lego just announced a new 5,000-piece Lord of the Rings fortress set that costs $460. Anyway, if you’re looking for a line to end a first date, that oughta do it."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah,Trump’s going to Barron’s high school graduation. Next week he’s going to Eric’s."
Seth Meyers,"[Matt] Gaetz and Boebert then appeared with their GOP colleagues outside the courthouse where they spent a lot of their time getting heckled. First, a protester held up a sign while Gaetz was talking that said, ‘Bootlickers.’ Of course, bootlicking is one of the things Trump paid hush money to cover up."
Seth Meyers,"At the end of the press conference, Boebert tried to speak but was heckled by protesters with mentions of the musical she got kicked out of. [Plays clip of crowd chanting ‘Beetlejuice’] Don’t say it three times!"
Seth Meyers,"My favorite part is when all her supposed friends just walk away and abandon her. Dudes, you’re not gonna help her out? ‘Ooof, it’s Lauren’s turn. Let’s get the f**k out of here."
Seth Meyers,"Well, it’s good publicity for Boebert, I guess, and good practice for Gaetz."
Seth Meyers,"Seriously, this is how grimy and pathetic the Republican Party’s become. The only thing sadder than having to sit in a dreary New York City courtroom for your porn star hush money trial is sitting in a dreary New York City courtroom for someone else’s porn star hush money trial. ‘We’re in the Big Apple! What, should we catch a Broadway show? Should we grab a hot dog? I got it—let’s go down to the courthouse and hear Stormy Daniels describe the worst sex of her life!'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Sitting front row at the Trump trial must be like the MAGA version of sitting courtside at a Knicks game. Except if someone says, ‘Wow, they’re even bigger up close,’ they’re talking about the bags under Trump’s eyes."
Seth Meyers,That’s not the charge. The charge is he funneled a hush money payment through his business and lied about it on official records to conceal it from voters during an election. You can’t do that. I can’t funnel a hush money payment through this show’s budget and call it something like wardrobe expenses. Mainly because everyone knows we don’t spend anything on my wardrobe.
Seth Meyers,"Democratic presidential candidate Jason Palmer announced yesterday that he’s ended his campaign, and he knew he’d made the right decision when the announcement echoed."
Seth Meyers,"The makers of Oreos yesterday unveiled new packaging inspired by the Star Wars franchise. The way it works is, the first three Oreos are pretty good, the next three are pretty bad, and the rest you eat just ’cause you ate the first six."
Desi Lydic,"Cohen is the linchpin of the government’s case because his testimony directly ties Trump to the falsification of business records. Which, remember, is the actual crime here. The porn star hush money part is just a little thing we keep saying because it’s fun."
Desi Lydic,"Look, I get the defense’s argument that you can’t trust Michael Cohen because he hates Donald Trump. But to be fair, everyone who’s ever worked with Donald Trump hates Donald Trump. At some point, you gotta be like, ‘I think it’s Trump.'"
Desi Lydic,"So Bob Menendez’s argument is that his wife was secretly orchestrating a corrupt international bribery scheme and hoarding gold bars in his own house and he never knew it. And that, gentlemen, is why you need to ask your wife about her day."
Desi Lydic,"Seriously though, the balls on this guy to throw his own wife under the bus. Is anyone buying this? Menendez’s lawyers are actually arguing that his wife had the gold bars because she’s of Lebanese descent, and the Lebanese love gold. Which is a stereotype I did not know even existed."
Desi Lydic,"Guys come on, after all that effort to remove that disgusting legacy we’re just putting the names back now? It’s like asking your doctor to reattach that hairy mole."
Desi Lydic,"Okay now, let’s be honest. This isn’t about restoring your heritage. If it was, then you’d name it, Hey, My Cousin’s Kinda Hot High School. I can make that joke because I’m from Kentucky and my cousin is kinda hot."
