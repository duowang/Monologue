Michael Kosta,"Its just so peculiar that, outside the courtroom with his legal pads full of notes, he just talks and talks and talks. But then if you ask him to walk just a few feet inside the courtroom and to swear to tell the truth under penalty of law, suddenly he’s afraid to speak? I mean, what’s the difference?

Michael Kosta,"This is not acceptable. Open AI should be punished for attempting to steal ScarJo’s voice. In fact, from now on they should have to use an off-putting voice. Like my uncle Dan who’s been smoking his whole life."
