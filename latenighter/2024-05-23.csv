Michael Kosta,"I always thought of Biden as a doddering old man, but Trump makes him look like one of The Expendables . ‘The rest of you take what you want, but leave the Orange Man to me.'"
Michael Kosta,"But you have to remember, these are not surveys of America… these are surveys of Americans who are willing to talk to a stranger who cold-calls them in the middle of a workday."
Michael Kosta,"It might just be me, but maybe we, as a society, shouldn’t have replaced newspapers with dudes ranting in cars?"
Michael Kosta,"Look, in a way, I get it. People don’t judge the economy based on data. They’re like, ‘You say the GDP is up but I say I used to be on my cousin’s Netflix account and now I have to get my own. So yeah, Jerome Powell, we’re in a recession, okay?'"
Michael Kosta,"[On independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s strategy of targeting so called “Reddit ape” online investors] “Now you might think it’s weird for RFK Jr to be going after this tiny little specific group. But don’t forget, America is just a bunch of tiny little specific groups. First he gets the Reddit apes, then he gets the furries, then the tradwives, cottagecore, TikTok, Disney adults, JetBlue frequent fliers with Mosaic Elite status, and then the next thing you know it’s January and he’s giving the State of the Union from Burning Man.” michael kosta"
Michael Kosta,What the f**k is going on here? Someone sent blood the RNC. I guess it could just be Rudy Giuliani’s lunch order.
Stephen Colbert,"Despite the fact that this is perfectly normal, Republicans are claiming that the FBI was ready to assassinate Donald Trump. In fact, Trump already sent out this fundraising email to his cult members: ‘They were authorized to shoot me! I nearly escaped death.’ I’m sorry, you nearly escaped death? Which means you didn’t? ‘That’s right, I almost made it out alive. Now I’m fundraising from heaven, which for some reason is very, very hot. And there’s nobody around here but my dear old friend, Jeffrey Epstein.'” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"And that makes sense. Once gay people get into something it always becomes a trend. Like RuPaul’s Drag Race , the music of Lady Gaga, or dressing like you have a shred of self-respect."
Stephen Colbert,"This is fun and this is joyful, so conservatives are having a total meltdown over it, with one right-wing Twitter user calling it ‘science revisionism for a satanic gay agenda,’ and another groused, ‘If animals were indeed gay there would be no more animals.’ Yes! So true. Just like how, because some people are gay, there are no more people."
Stephen Colbert,Remember the classified documents case? When the nuclear codes [were] offered as one of the toppings at Mar-a-Lago’s waffle bar?
Stephen Colbert,"That’s never a good sign. No one ever says, ‘Take these toy donations to the orphanage—and avoid security cameras.'"
Stephen Colbert,"That scandal is exactly much worse than we could have thought, because we just learned that his lawyers found classified documents in Donald Trump’s bedroom four months after the search of Mar-a-Lago.Oh my God, the only thing more shocking to find in Donald Trump’s bedroom would be a current wife."
Stephen Colbert,"Earlier this week, Trump’s social media account put out a bit of disturbing content. It was a campaign video with a headline about a ‘Unified Reich.’ Now before you get too worked up, there’s a simple explanation. Donald Trump wants to rule over a unified reich."
Jimmy Kimmel,We will pray—that someday you are able to experience an emotion called shame.
Jimmy Kimmel,"We also learned that Mar-a-Lardo had stolen documents in his bedroom, in his bathroom, and scattered around on the floor. Basically he had documents everywhere Shaggy got caught having sex in the song ‘It Wasn’t Me.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Special Counsel believes that Trump did even more to obstruct the investigation than we’ve previously known. It looks like Trump moved the boxes of classified documents out of Mar-a-Lago and then realized he had to move them back in without it being captured on security cameras. [Shows photo] This is Trump’s right-hand man, Walt Nauta, moving large boxes. Or to be fair, this could have been Trump’s lunch order.” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Sexually transmitted infections have been around for a very long time. In fact, researchers from Brazil just released newly discovered evidence. They tested bones from skeletons and found that Neanderthals had an ancient form of herpes. Either that or the night watchman at the museum has some explaining to do."
Jimmy Fallon,The lawyers knew Trump was hiding something when they saw a box labeled ‘books.'
Jimmy Fallon,"A fire broke out in a Tesla factory in California that started in an oven. Luckily, it’s a Tesla factory so the fire department was already there."
Jimmy Fallon,"The Trump campaign just announced that they’re now accepting donations in cryptocurrency.Not to be outdone, President Biden announced that he’s now accepting donations in Werther’s Originals and ear-quarters."
