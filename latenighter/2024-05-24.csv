Michael Kosta,Usually we expect this esteemed body to sit above partisan pettiness while it issues rulings that let corporations sell my organs for profit. But last week an unfortunate issue sullied that image.
Michael Kosta,"Yeah, Mrs. Alito’s fault… I feel you, Sammy, you know? My wife’s always squabbling with the neighbors, too. I mean, her squabbles don’t usually end with her raising the flag of insurrection against the United States, but…"
Michael Kosta,"What the hell, man, another flag? Did this guy get a two-for-one deal at the MAGA flag store?"
Michael Kosta,"The good news is that the Supreme Court has a code of ethics. Now, the bad news is they wrote that code of ethics and they don’t follow it. So I guess there is no good news and the bad news is even worse."
Michael Kosta,"What the hell, Nikki? What happened to that Margaret Thatcher quote about never following the crowd? Is there another Margaret Thatcher quote where she said, ‘You know what, who gives a sh*t, just follow the crowd, whatever?'"
Michael Kosta,"And it’s not the hypocrisy that annoys me here. Every loser ends up supporting their party’s nominee. But Haley made this whole big show about withholding her support, and then she gave it up for nothing. She’d be the worst kidnapper ever. ‘If you wanna see you child, send me one million dollars in unmarked bills… You know what, forget it, I’ll drop him off at 5.'"
Michael Kosta,"To Trump, Haley voters are like vegetables. He’s gotten this far without ‘em, why worry about them now?"
Michael Kosta,"Enjoy being ambassador to those islands where the nuclear bombs get tested, Nikki!"
Michael Kosta,"Of course, the rising popularity of weed is a good reminder to the beer industry that they got lazy. They thought they could just sit back and relax while Tommy Chong bought every goddamn ad on Twitter, you know? Congrats, beer companies. You lost to that well known super-ambitious, type A, hard working go-getter, Tommy Chong."
Michael Kosta,"Thats right, daily pot smokers are beating daily alcohol drinkers in the race to see who can escape their sad lives more quickly."
Michael Kosta,"But in some ways it makes sense. Edibles are just more efficient than booze. I mean, have you ever tried to get a trick or treater drunk? It’s almost impossible."
Stephen Colbert,"That’s right, a second flag at a second home. Alito’s second wife better watch her back."
Stephen Colbert,"When asked about it, Johnson said, ‘It’s George Washington’s flag, it has nothing to do with stop the steal.’ Yes it does. When a forgotten symbol is brought back and widely coopted, you don’t get to use it in the old way. If a guy named Brandon says, ‘Actually, this swastika above my bed is referring to the ancient Sanskrit symbol for good luck,’ he’s a Nazi, Cheryl—get out of there!"
Stephen Colbert,"Besides, Mike Johnson is a political figure. It’s one thing if he wants to fly the team flag. Sam Alito keeps saying that everyone on the Supreme Court is unbiased and non-political. I mean there’s nothing wrong if Aaron Judge wears a Yankees jersey. But it’s different if the umpire does it."
Stephen Colbert,She folded like a paper plate on chili night.
Stephen Colbert,"Some may be surprised by this, but as a New Yorker I am not. I smoke weed every single day whether I want to or not on the sidewalk literally everywhere I go."
Stephen Colbert,"Now remember, this is daily or near-daily use. ‘Cause in overall numbers, alcohol is still more widely used. So congratulations, weekend binge drinkers, you still have the biggest problem."
Stephen Colbert,This news has alcohol makers worried. They’ve changed their standard disclaimer from ‘drink responsibly’ to ‘please drink.'
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, so I forget, is it laptops in, shoes off? Laptops out, shoes on? Just to be safe I’m gonna put my laptop in my shoes."
Stephen Colbert,"When she really needs his attention, she prints those on a slice of baloney."
Stephen Colbert,Trump posts a campaign ad calling for a “unified reich
Jimmy Fallon,"Of course, fleet week kicked off yesterday here in New York City with the parade of ships, and it ends Tuesday when all the bartenders wave a white flag."
Jimmy Fallon,Today a new airline for dogs called Bark Air took its first flight from New York to L.A. The flights take a little longer because the plane has to do three circles before it lands.
