Seth Meyers,"I want to start by addressing the pessimists who say, ‘I don’t think this conviction will make a difference.’ Not. Today."
Seth Meyers,"Here’s a good rule of thumb. If you have a closet full of skeletons, don’t announce a campaign for the most closely scrutinized office in the entire world. This is like someone in the witness protection program joining the Real Housewives of New Jersey ."
Seth Meyers,‘I couldn’t testify because if I lied that’s perjury’ is not the iron-clad defense he thinks it is.
Seth Meyers,"Former President Trump has been found guilty on all 34 charges in his criminal hush money trial and faces up to four years in prison. Well, for what its worth, all your friends are already there, you know? It’s like what my wife tells me on the way to a dinner party, ‘Don’t worry, you’ll know people.'"
Seth Meyers,"In a new interview after his conviction, former President Trump said that his hush money criminal trial was held in ‘maybe the worst area in the whole country’ for him. That’s right, his home town where people know him best."
Seth Meyers,”That’s like Bart Simpson claiming he never said ‘Cowabunga.'
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump saying he never said ‘Lock her up’ brings us to a segment called, What’s the Play Here? I mean obviously we have clips that prove he said ‘Lock her up,’ and he knows we have clips that prove he said it. So what’s the play here? Is he trying to bait me into showing the clips to make me seem like the bully and him seem like the victim? Or does he think it doesn’t matter if we show the clips because no one who believes him is also watching this show? I mean, is there a single, living human who’s thinking, ‘Maybe he didn’t say Lock Her Up’ and, also, ‘I never miss A Closer Look?’ What’s… what’s the play here? Maybe this is his plan to send me into an existential crisis trying to choose between trying to prove he’s lying to an audience that already knows he’s lying, or not showing the clip, which, sure, saves us time, but also lets him off the hook. But do we not risk falling into the same trap that the media continues to fall into with Trump, where the flood of lies, contradictions, and mistruths is so unending that you throw up your hands and say, ‘What does any of it even matter?’ [Long pause] What’s the play here? You know what, it does matter. It might not make a difference but it does matter. Sometimes, you gotta be like a New York jury who knows bullsh*t when you see it. You never said, ‘Lock her up?’ Roll the clips!” seth meyers"

Stephen Colbert,"I agree this is truly an historic moment, as Donald Trump becomes the first U.S. President convicted of a crime. Although they almost nailed Martin Van Buren for hot-wiring a horse."
Stephen Colbert,"It’s gonna be The RNC Live from Cell Block B, with a keynote speech from his warden, his cellmate Spider, that one guard who smuggles in cellphones up his butt. And, for the cocktail hour, enjoy complimentary toilet wine!"
Stephen Colbert,It’s true… just think about that. If it could happen to him. it could happen to anyone—who commits crimes.
Stephen Colbert,"Just because there’s ample evidence and a jury believes it, anyone could now be found guilty. Do we really want to live in an America where the law is applied equally regardless of how rich you are?"
Stephen Colbert,"won’t stand” for him going to jail] “Oh. It would be tough for ‘the public?’ Actually, I happen to have a large number of the public here. Hey public what do you all think about Trump going to jail?"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Folks, I was talking about Hilary Swank, okay? No baby is worth a million dollars.'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘The people’ said ‘Lock her up?’ That was your whole campaign—stop it. We were there, we remember. It’s like if Arby’s said, ‘We never said We Have the Meats, the people said We Have the Meats.'"
Stephen Colbert,"At the ripe age of 93, Rupey has found love again. ‘Cause over the weekend he married his fifth wife, Yelena Zhukova. It was the world’s first open casket wedding."

Jimmy Kimmel,How dare you explain what I did to my wife to my wife.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Somehow, even though Joe Biden has weaponized the American justice system, using them as puppets to prosecute his rivals, somehow this one that could get his son 26 years in prison slipped through his iron grip."
Jon Stewart,"Oh my God! The justice system hunts Republicans while protecting Democrats! Someone should mention that to such unprotected Democrats as Senator Robert Menendez and Congressman Henry Cuellar, both facing corruption charges brought by our Department of Justice. Not to mention Hunter Biden was facing jury selection in a federal gun charges trial f**king today!"
Jon Stewart,What the f**k? You never said ‘Lock her up?’ I think I remember you saying it to her face in a debate.
Jon Stewart,"And that ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, is why we need courts. It does appear to be the last place in America where you can’t just say whatever the f**k you want."
