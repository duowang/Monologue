Seth Meyers,"In a new interview, former President Trump said that his hush money criminal trial was tougher on his family than it was on him. Yeah, no kidding. Not only did it not keep you up at night, it didn’t keep you up during the day."
Seth Meyers,"In the same interview, Trump said that he would be willing to serve jail time after being convicted on 34 felony counts. Which would be the first time he’s shared a bedroom in a while."
Seth Meyers,"At a press conference yesterday, New York Mayor Eric Adams announced plans to build or renovate more than 80 public restrooms, because New Yorkers deserve a clean and safe place to do drugs."
Seth Meyers,"According to a new study, the second dirtiest city in America is Newark, New Jersey. And the first place—whichever city is down river from Newark, New Jersey."
Seth Meyers,"According to a new survey, more than half of Americans think they’re out of touch with popular culture. Not me though. I know WHASSUP!! “ seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Today was National Hug Your Cat Day, brought to you by Neosporin."
Seth Meyers,"According to a new poll, 34 percent of Republicans said that they are more likely to vote for former President Trump following his felony conviction. Okay, but that 34 percent was always going to vote for him. That’s like Snoop Dogg saying, ‘I’m really gonna smoke weed now.’"
Ronny Chieng,"Okay, he’s definitely in that file. He is in the Epstein files— he’s already like, ‘Look, there’s gonna be a lot of phony stuff in there: names, pictures, my DNA, you can’t believe any of it.'"
Ronny Chieng,"This is the same guy who said that Obama was born in Kenya and Ted Cruz’s dad killed JFK, okay? Now all of a sudden he’s like, ‘Look, if you put some inaccurate information out there, it could really destroy someone’s reputation.'"
Ronny Chieng,You don’t need to ask Trump to declassify anything. He’s just going to leave it at the buffet table at Mar-a-Lago.
Ronny Chieng,"Border security is one of President Biden’s biggest weaknesses. It’s why he tried to make a border deal with Republicans earlier this year. It’s also why Republicans refused to make a deal with him. They were like, ‘How can we blame you for this if you fix it, you idiot.'"
Ronny Chieng,I’ve gotta give liberals a bit of a reality check. It’s not very popular to have no control over who immigrates to your country. Just ask the Native Americans.
Ronny Chieng,"Now look, the fact is that immigrants are vital for America’s economy and its culture. And also, let’s be honest, America needs a better World Cup team."
Ronny Chieng,"That’s right, Elon Musk in now no longer the biggest ass on Twitter."
Ronny Chieng,"Basically, instead of fixing the porn problem, Elon just decided,’ Hey it’s not a problem any more.’ Hey, I’m not hating. That’s how I handle issues in my life, too. I mean, those aren’t bedbugs, they’re my new roommates."
Ronny Chieng,"The way Twitter is now, a bukkake video would elevate the discourse."
Ronny Chieng,"Look at this typical communist sh*t. Hey North Korea, you don’t stick trash in a balloon and float it over to your enemy, okay? How about you join the free world and put your trash in the ocean where it belongs?"
Ronny Chieng,"It does show you how clean South Korea is, though, because if Kim Jong Un flew trash into New York City, no one would even notice, okay? Trash would land on trash that was already there and people would be like, ‘Oh great, the neighborhood garbage pile has a fancy balloon now.'"
Stephen Colbert,"So the Democrat you’d be willing to sit down with is a guy who’s no longer a Democrat who you used to meet with and now refuse to ever speak to again. Do you understand how hypotheticals work? ‘Let’s see, what three albums would I bring to a desert island? Well I’d screw Stormy, marry Melania, and kill Eric.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, somebody said ‘How do you live?’ That somebody—his doctor. ‘Uh, mister Trump, Iv’e got your results right here—How do you live? Your blood type came back as honey mustard.'"
Stephen Colbert,"So, the reason to be good is because of heaven? That’s like a kid saying, ‘If it’s not for the Elf on the Shelf, I’d murder my parents.'"
Stephen Colbert,"That is a tough needle to thread, being an anti-immigration liberal. ‘So we’re gonna seal the border folks, but the wall is going to be gluten-free, and the barbed wire will be pro-choice. It’s not a border wall, it’s a bord-her wall.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Now this order, it’s not playing great with progressives. In fact, back in February, AOC tweeted this about the then-proposal, ‘Seeking asylum is a legal right of all people. Doing Trump impressions isn’t how we beat Trump.’ She’s right folks, doing Trump impressions is how you fill 13 minutes of monologue every night."
Stephen Colbert,"‘Anything that causes sexual arousal’ on the internet? That narrows it down to—anything. ‘Oooh, Spongebob playing his nose like a flute. Daddy like.'"
Stephen Colbert,"What? That is terrible. Now young, impressionable people are going to come across porn while they were just innocently trying to post their Neo-Nazi memes."
Stephen Colbert,"That’s right, he’s courting the youth vote where the kids hang—print media. Next stop, zeppelins."
Stephen Colbert,"I believe it is brave for Biden to do this cover because he’s side by side with his nemesis, time."
Stephen Colbert,"Hey buddy, making fun of congressman is my job. Back off—I don’t come to kindergarten and sleep on your scrap of rug."
Stephen Colbert,How bad do you have to be to have Wisconsin go after you when your name is Chesebro? That’s like the attorney general of Idaho indicting Mr. Potato Head.
Jimmy Kimmel,This is like what neighbors in Staten Island do to each other.
Jimmy Kimmel,"If North Korea sent a thousand trash balloons to L.A., we’d have no idea. We’d be like, ‘Oh look, it’s the garbage’s birthday.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"We don’t know who Vice President Harris will be debating because Donald Trump hasn’t picked a running mate yet. It’s between Marco Rubio, Tim Scott, Kid Rock, and a Monster energy drink."
Jimmy Fallon,New York City just launched an official map of all the public restrooms across the five boroughs. Or you could just open Google Maps and search Barnes & Noble.
Jimmy Fallon,"I heard about three boys who were hiking at a national park in North Dakota when they discovered a T. Rex fossil. When it comes to going on a hike and finding bones in a park, that’s pretty much the best case scenario."
Jimmy Fallon,"doctor”] “She was like, ‘If you’re a real doctor, how come you’re not walking towards me with a straitjacket?'"
