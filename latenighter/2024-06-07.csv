Stephen Colbert,Once again these vets did an incredible service for their nation. They made Joe Biden look young.
Stephen Colbert,"D-Day of course was the turning point in defeating the Nazis. The original Nazis, not the gritty reboot."
Stephen Colbert,"No gun. He’s gonna have to change one of his signature brags. [Trump voice] ‘Tell you what, I could still stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and, I don’t know, give someone a purple nurple. Sack tap, atomic wedgie—wouldn’t lose a single vote.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Wait a second, it’s against the law to buy guns when using drugs? Okay who’s going to arrest Florida?"
Stephen Colbert,"Menendez’s strategy has been to blame his wife, a movie know in legal circles as ‘the Alito.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes they’re two different people. It’s like that old book, Men Are From Mars, Women Keep a Locked Closet Full of Gold ."
Stephen Colbert,"This whole story will be covered on the crime drama, Halal and Order: Shawarma Victims Unit ."
Stephen Colbert,And you do not want to be ‘the villain in an Egyptian meat controversy.’ Or for that matter the hero in an Egyptian meat controversy. I just stay clear of controversial meat in general.
Stephen Colbert,"[Trump voice] ‘What they’ve done is horrible and has to stop which is why I can do it, too. As Jesus says in the Bible, ‘If a man strike you on the cheek… Hulk smash.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Blocking federal access to contraception isn’t just, dumb it’s also wildly unpopular. Recent polls say that 80 percent of voters said that protecting access to contraception was ‘deeply important’ to them. The other 20 percent of them are your high school boyfriend who says that condoms don’t work anyway and you can’t get pregnant in a hot tub."
Ronny Chieng,Spending time with these veterans is extremely important to Joe Biden because being next to them is the only time he looks young.
Ronny Chieng,We honor all the brave soldiers who fought the Nazis in France so that we today could have the freedom to fight them on Twitter.
Ronny Chieng,"The NYPD is officially revoking Donald Trump’s gun permit in New York, because as a convicted felon he’s not allowed to use a firearm any more. Of course there is a bit of loophole because if he becomes President, he gets all the nukes. How does that make sense? He can’t have a hunting rifle but he can drop the A-bomb on Bambi?"
Ronny Chieng,"Wait, Trump is doing background checks on possible VPs? Why? What’s he going to find out about someone else that’s worse than what he’s done? Yo, this dude’s got fraud, sexual assault, infidelity, tax evasion, bankruptcies, impeachment, he hung out with Epstein. I mean, is he really going to find something and be like, ‘J.D. Vance got a parking ticket in 1994? I can’t be associated with a man like that.'” ronny chieng"
Ronny Chieng,"I will say I’m impressed with the diversity in this list. I mean, three Black guys. Although it is less impressive when you consider that Trump thinks all of them are Herman Cain."
Ronny Chieng,"Luckily, prison won’t be a big change for him because he already smells like a pack of cigarettes that was smuggled in someone’s ass."
Ronny Chieng,"Even the skinheads are gonna be like, ‘Damn, this new guy has some rough opinions about immigrants.'"
Ronny Chieng,"I mean, this dide doesn’t look like he’s going into prison, he looks like he just escaped. Tell me this guy didn’t just crawl through a 500-yard pipe of shit, okay."
Ronny Chieng,"Pride Month started as an anti-establishment protest, but over the last few decades it’s gone mainstream. There are parades in every city, Pizza Hut puts out gay boxes, and even Exxon changes all its oil spills to a rainbow color. #Ally."
Ronny Chieng,"Yo, what is up with Ron DeSantis? I mean, I can’t believe a guy who rocks three-inch heels is such a dick to the gay community."
Ronny Chieng,"By the way, red, white, and blue-colored lights on crumbling infrastructure? Perfect metaphor for America."
Ronny Chieng,"I don’t get how anyone could be so angry about rainbow flags. I mean, it must be exhausting to be that homophobic. You know, just eating a bag of Skittle being like, ‘No homo! [chomping sound] ‘No homo!'"
Ronny Chieng,That does it. From now on I will be going somewhere else I can pretend to shop so I can poop in the bathroom.
Jimmy Kimmel,"80 years ago on this day, American, British, and Canadian troops stormed the beaches of Normandy to fight the forces of good people on both sides."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know, Donald Trump in 2018 opted not to visit the graves of American soldiers in France because he didn’t want to get his hair wet, and also he called them ‘suckers’ and ‘losers.’ Even though the only thing that he ever stormed was Daniels."
Jimmy Kimmel,Now if he wants to shoot someone on 5th Avenue he’s gonna have to do it with a crossbow.
Jimmy Kimmel,"How are these guys, how are they not ashamed of themselves? We have this on video. At least Tim Scott has been slurping Trump’s ass since the first day. The rest of them are such spineless, impotent, bootlicking slugs. The only thing that surprises me is that Ted Cruz isn’t on the list, really."
Jimmy Kimmel,"[Trump]’s got a fundraiser here in Beverly Hills tomorrow. It’s 250 thousand dollars a person. But you know, it’s not every day you get to take a selfie with a convicted felon who can’t control his gas."
Seth Meyers,"If he wins, they won’t be able to swear him in on the Bible until that one inmate comes around with the book cart."
Seth Meyers,"[On a favorite Fox talking point] “It’s truly grotesque to compare Trump to late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. When Navalny was sentenced to yet another prison term last year, the trial was held in an unidentified room in Penal Colony Number 6 in the Vladimir region and the media and even Navalny’s parents were barred from attending. Unlike Trump’s family, who weren’t barred from attending though they did act like they were.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Melania never showed her face in court once, though I’m sure Trump tried to get her to come. [Trump voice] “Mel… Mel, I’d love to have you join me in court today for support. Mel… Which trial is it? Ummm, do you remember when I paid hush money to the adul… Mel, when you turn on your hair dryer you know I know you can’t hear me.'"
Seth Meyers,"According to a new poll, 58 percent of Republican voters believe that convicted felons should be allowed to become President if they are elected. Which is up 58 percent from last week."
Seth Meyers,"Not only did Trump get a fair trial, he got the luxury version of a fair trial. He got Platinum Status due process."
Seth Meyers,"Most criminal defendants in this country don’t get a fraction of the leeway and deference Trump has gotten and is still getting. He had expensive lawyers, access to all the evidence, he was personally involved in the jury selection, the trial happened in full view of the media and the world. He was cited for contempt 10 times and never once thrown in jail. You know your weird uncle Rocky who got pinched because he was doing 90 in a school zone with a Ziploc bag full of loose pills in his glove compartment? I guarantee you if uncle Ricky fell asleep in court and badmouthed the judge one time he would have had his ass thrown in county lockup.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"According to a new report, former President Trump’s guilty verdict has brought his entire family closer together. They’ve gotten so close, Tiffany doesn’t even need her name tag."
Seth Meyers,"Republican Senator Rand Paul said yesterday that if former President Trump wants to get his support, Trump will have to be ‘more vocal’ on issues he supports. More vocal? The man yells when he talks and writs in all caps. If you read his speeches in Braille, it would draw blood."
Jimmy Fallon,Good luck. It’s like signing up to be the babysitter in The Exorcist .
Jimmy Fallon,You’ve got to appreciate the irony of a convicted felon running a background check.
Jimmy Fallon,One source said that Trump’s VP pick could be influenced by the fact that he likes people who are rich and who have ‘hot wives.’ Well at least he’s taking this seriously.
Jimmy Fallon,Bannon goes to prison on July first. It’s too bad we’re all gonna miss out on seeing that summer beach bod.
Jimmy Fallon,"Costco plans to stop selling books except for before the holidays. That’s too bad, I always liked going to Costco and buying a 20 gallon tub of John Grisham novel."
