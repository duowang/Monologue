name,monologue
Seth Meyers,"On Sunday, Trump held his first large rally since his guilty verdict, where he laid out a detailed policy plan to tackle the nation’s challenges and I’m just kidding, he screamed about teleprompters, batteries and sharks."
Seth Meyers,Former President Trump told the crowd he was ‘sweating like a dog.’ And he was immediately shot by Kristi Noem.
Seth Meyers,"It was so bad, Trump began exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke ten years ago."
Seth Meyers,"You know, nobody’s ever asked me that question"
Seth Meyers,"That sounds like a question for Math for Dummies by Dummies . ‘A boat sinks to the bottom of the ocean—big boat, strong boat—and there’s a tremendously powerful battery ten yards away from the shark. The shark is “woke"
Seth Meyers,"Let’s make something clear. If a probation officer is basing their sentencing guidelines on remorse, mental state and character, and the recommendation is a day less than one thousand years, Donald Trump is getting off easy."
Seth Meyers,But that’s everyone he knows. Telling Donald Trump he can’t associate with anyone with a criminal record is like telling Andy Cohen he can only associate with fake housewives.
Seth Meyers,"You know who this is really bad news for, his family. Now he’s gonna have to spend more time with them. Melania is so worried about this, she’s probably gonna knock over a liquor store in broad daylight just so she can have a rap sheet."
Seth Meyers,"Doctor ” Phil McGraw, “Sometimes, revenge can be justified"
Seth Meyers,"Usually when there’s this much space in Manhattan, it means that someone took a dump on a subway car."
Seth Meyers,"Doctor” Phil McGraw pitch softball questions to an unrepentant Trump on TV] “I’d say I can’t believe this guy’s a doctor, but the other guy was fully the President so what the hell, everybody gets to call themselves whatever they want from now on! Hey, everybody! Hello, hello, I’m Captain Seth Meyers of the USS F*ck This!"
Seth Meyers,"I think good,” to a question about how Melania is doing] “‘I think good?’ Thats not how you answer a question about how your wife is doing. That’s how you answer a question about how your great aunt Gloria is doing. ‘i think good. I mean, I think I would have seen something on Facebook if she died.'"
Stephen Colbert,"I’m not saying Trump doesn’t care about his followers, but Trump is saying it. [Clip of Trump explicitly saying he only cares about his followers’ votes and not them, and then complaining that the media will claim he said it] Of course if you say a horrible thing, people are gonna say what you said is horrible. That’s how words work."
Stephen Colbert,"Here’s the deal. if you’re willing to stand out in the desert listening to some maniac ramble until your skull bursts open like a bag of Jiffy Pop, you’re in a cult. Or you’re at Coachella. Either way get out of there and take off the stupid hat."
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, Someone definitely has heat stroke. It might be me just for watching that. Do you smell toast?"
Stephen Colbert,"If he wins, his inaugural address is just gonna be a big game of Would You Rather. ‘My fellow Americans, to heal this divided nation I call on you to answer the crucial question of our time: Would you rather sleep on a bed of snakes or eat a bowl of doo-doo?'"
Stephen Colbert,the man that I worship is also a convicted felon
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, she means Jesus. Of course, they’re like the same guy.

But if I had to choose between sharks and electrocution, I go electrocution every time.'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Okay Mr. Trump, says you got fired from your last job for being terrible at it and for trying to [checks notes] kill a Mr. Mike Pence? But I see right here you’re currently applying for anew job which is [check notes again] the same job. Have you thought about learning to code?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Unlike the vast majority of felons out there, Trump was allowed to do his interview at Mar-a-Lago over a video conference call. Must make the mandatory drug test kind of difficult. Gotta get the pee right into the USB port. Might want to use a dongle."
Stephen Colbert,I hope you all had a great weekend. I did. I mean the weather here in New York is absolutely Donald Trump is a convicted felon.
Jimmy Fallon,Trump met with his probation officer over Zoom. Which was great because Trump’s lawyer could hit mute whenever he started talking.
Jimmy Fallon,Things got off to a rough start when Trump offered the parole officer 130 thousand dollars.
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, Noah Lyles is the fastest man in the world. Stormy Daniels heard and was like, ‘Uh, beg to differ.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Martha’s Vineyard is close to running out of marijuana. So if want to know how worried Obama is about Biden winning the election, there’s your answer."
Jimmy Fallon,"Kia is recalling 463,000 SUVs because the front seats can catch on fire. Kia recalled the cars and then Kia owners were like, ‘Hey why don’t you come and get them?'"
Jon Stewart,"Pride Month is of course that time of year when corporations get together and financially exploit the decades-long struggle of gay people for acceptance and equality. ‘Hey, remember when you were fired from that bank job after you were outed? Well, Burger King does! With a burger that has two bottom buns ! Yeah, thats not a funny make-em-up."
Jon Stewart,"What the f*ck? Yeah, the next time you waste an enormous amount of paint to apologize to your daughter for making her and her girlfriend walk on f*ckin’ eggshells all f*ckin’ weekend, not even saying anything, just standing there with your glowering little beard face in the shadows, you paint the fence and give her an Oreo?"
Jon Stewart,"And then there’s Target. Pride Month means so much to them that they set up one small area in their 20,000 square feet of store to sell you a Pride t-shirt they had made in Indonesia for 29 cents landed, because they believe so much in the cause."
Jon Stewart,gay and a pervert”] “Even if I’m just getting paper towels?
Jon Stewart,"Yeah, they ran the numbers and they found out they can sell more cellphones in a dictatorship."
Jon Stewart,"The first thing I think is, ‘You’re the ones with all the f*ckin’ food!'"
Jon Stewart,"And I just wanted to say to Pat Sajak, have you thought about just doing Mondays? Because you can just phone that sh*t in."
