Stephen Colbert,"Now I know that seems shady, but it’s a legitimate interview technique taught at the Borat School of Journalism."
Stephen Colbert,The Borat School of Journalism is also where Alito learned to blame everything on [Borat impression] ‘Mah wife!'
Stephen Colbert,"You’re a Supreme Court justice. You’re not supposed to be thinking what side someone is on, you’re supposed to decide cases. Impartial. That’s why Lady Justice has a blindfold and a scale, not 3-D glasses and a popcorn bucket."
Stephen Colbert,"You come after me, I’m gonna give it back to you."
Stephen Colbert,"‘Satisfy yourself,’ really? I’m not gonna kink-shame but why is her anger always channeled through flags? I’d love to see her get cut off in traffic. ‘Oooh, have I got a flag in my head for you, Subaru Outback. Just two weeks from now [mimes sewing], just you wait. Oh, you are gonna get it. Siri navigate to Joann Fabrics.'"
Stephen Colbert,"vergogna,” the Italian word for ‘shame"
Stephen Colbert,Now that is truy shocking news. Evidently in America there is a wrong way to buy a gun.
Stephen Colbert,"‘Sorry folks, that one’s on me. I mistakenly used an old statement and just did a find-and-replace for the name Jeffery Epstein.'"
Stephen Colbert,"That’s right, no liquor at Trump’s golf courses. In a related story, Rudy Giuliani has announced he’s voting for Joe Biden."
Stephen Colbert,"Of course this is New Jersey, so by ‘reputable,’ they mean, if your gonna do Fireball shots out of a strippers butt crack, use a coaster. I want to make a joke about ‘salting the rim,’ but I won’t."
Stephen Colbert,"C’mon, it’s an 81-year-old man. Of course he’s going for the early bird special."

Jordan Klepper,"satisfies” her] “First off, what a burn on Justice Alito. Your wife is going around telling strangers that she has to think up new flags to satisfy herself. ‘I gotta think up new flags, because it’s not like there’s anybody else taking care of my needs. Somebody’s gotta Plessy my Ferguson , c’mon.'"
Jordan Klepper,Wow. Frankly I’m shocked we’re actually enforcing gun laws in America. Halle-f**king-lujah.
Jordan Klepper,"What has been wild is watching how eager Republicans have been to hold a gun owner accountable. Of course, it’s only because he’s Joe Biden’s son, but that’s an opportunity. All we need is for Joe Biden to adopt every single person in America and we can finally have some responsible gun control in this country."

And it might cost you some votes in the suburbs. But from time to time, leaders are called upon to envision a better future. Be bold in the implementation and execution. And be undaunted by the opposition. That’s how you secure progress. Wait a second, I heard that somewhere before. [Plays clip of Hochul using those exact words in December of 2023] Sh*t! Kathy Hochul has an evil twin who is good at governing, who knew?” jordan klepper"

[Clip of Sean Hannity predicting Biden will be juiced up for the upcoming debates] Right, and Trump will have his usual pre-debate meal of chicken fried in Adderall."
Jimmy Kimmel,"And if there’s anything that voters in the middle of the desert in Las Vegas are worried about, it’s electric boats and shark attacks."
