Seth Meyers,This is the contradiction of how the right wants us to see Biden. He’s either a puppet master pulling all the strings or he’s a puppet who’s puppeteer has taken the day off.
Seth Meyers,"That’s right, Joe Biden weaponized the Justice Department against his own son. Hunter must be so mad!"
Seth Meyers,You guys only think Joe Biden would frame his own son because that’s definitely something Trump would do. He probably only named him Don Jr so he could pin crimes on him.
Seth Meyers,"A quick disclaimer for anyone who’s mad about my ‘Biden is old’ jokes. It’s fine. He’s the most powerful man in the world. He can take a joke, as we’ve made clear on this show repeatedly. There’s no equivalency between a competent 81-year-old who occasionally shows sign of age and a demented 77-year-old criminal who says dead people rigged the election and thinks electric boat batteries will lead to shark attacks.” seth meyers"
Jordan Klepper,Let me tell you something. Nobody is taking the fall for Joe Biden. He falls plenty on his own… thank you very much.
Jordan Klepper,"When Donald Trump was convicted, you didn’t see Democrats going, ‘I bet this is just a distraction from the classified documents case. Or the January 6 case. Or the Georgia racketeering case. Or the E. Jean Carroll case. Or the insurance fraud case…'"
Jordan Klepper,"Okay. I don’t want to make any assumptions about a guy’s drug use, but if I were Don Jr, I would not try to buy a gun in Delaware."
Jordan Klepper,"No, Democrats were celebrating. I was in a Brooklyn Whole Foods when the verdict came down—people started f**king in the bulk grains aisle."
Jordan Klepper,"C’mon Nathans, you’re gonna ban Joey Chestnut just for taking a sponsorship deal? He’s got a family to feed… and feed… and feed…"
Jordan Klepper,"By the way, the record for eating vegan hot dogs? Two and a half."
Jordan Klepper,"Can I just say how weird is that in the last couple of weeks, Hunter Biden and Donald Trump were convicted of lying on paperwork. I mean, this country really does draw the line at fillng out forms correctly."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump has an interview with his probation officers on Monday during which he reportedly admitted that he still has a gun back in Florida. Which is bad, because that could be a violation of his parole, and could also potentially be another felony, a felony gun charge. Who does this guy think he think he is, Hunter Biden?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Wait, which President’s son is on crack?"
Jimmy Kimmel,These summits are always interesting because whenever Joe Biden hears G7 he yells ‘Bingo!'
Jimmy Kimmel,It’s like if Cookie Monster signed a deal with celery.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The good news is for Joey, he might not die quite as soon."
Jimmy Kimmel,"On Thursday, Trump will meet with House Republicans to discuss how they will govern if he wins, or how they will pretend he won if he doesn’t win."
Stephen Colbert,"[On the Biden campaign’s outreach to older voters, including pickleball tournaments and bingo] “Careful Joe, at your age you could break a hip… playing bingo."
Stephen Colbert,"Off screen, we couldn’t see it, there was a T-Rex and he was hiding."
Stephen Colbert,"This is like barring LeBron James from basketball, or Aaron Rodgers from podcasting."
Stephen Colbert,"Just like everything else in America, meat has now become politicized as what some are calling the meat culture war. Sounds stupid, but on the bright side I can’t wait for all the meat war movies like Apocalypse Cow and Full Metal Brisket ."
Stephen Colbert,"This vegan meat backlash is all part of the anti-science that brought you ‘vaccines are bad’ and ‘smallpox is back.’ Recently, Cracker Barrel started offering Impossible Sausages, which far-right commenters have been calling ‘5-G sausages"
Stephen Colbert,Am I excited? Is the pope Catholic? I’ll let you know after I meet the freakin’ pope!
Stephen Colbert,I hope we get to meet that original priest and rabbi who walked into that bar!
Stephen Colbert,"Chris, for safety’s sake, I would just keep Mary Magdalene’s name out of your mouth."
Stephen Colbert,"Why, Pope Frankie, why? You’re the progressive pope. You’ve made landmark statements in support of same-sex civil unions, conducted LGBTQ+ outreach, and said of gay priests, ‘Who am I to judge?’ Evidently you were the pope."
Stephen Colbert,I cant believe I am alive for the first time anyone has ever been disappointed by the Catholic Church!
Stephen Colbert,It’s not easy to be less tolerant than NASCAR. You know their slogan: Pretty Sure Our Fans Did January 6.
Stephen Colbert,The bishops tried to stop him but they couldn’t get to him in time because they can only move diagonally.
Jimmy Fallon,Usually when an 81-year-old does that much traveling through Europe it’s on a Viking river cruise.
Jimmy Fallon,"You’ll know the astronauts are drinking too much red wine when they’re like, ‘No Houston, you’re the one with the problem.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"According to a new Harvard study, aliens could be living among us disguised as humans, or living in a base inside the moon. Yep, that study proves once and for all that Harvard kids can afford the best weed."
