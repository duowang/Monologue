Jordan Klepper,"I mean, imagine if you were a serious Republican congressman in that room, who came to work that day to get things done and make life better for your constituents—that person does not exist. But imagine how annoyed they would be."
Jordan Klepper,"Isn’t that embarrassing for everybody involved? A room of adults wearing suits saying, ‘Let’s discuss our agenda to dismantle the regulations to protect our environment, but first—who’s the big boy gettin’ a year older!'"
Jordan Klepper,"Trump went back on Capitol Hill for the first time since January 6. And it must have felt like visiting your old high school, you know? Walking the halls, so many memories flooding back. ‘I remember Joey taking a dump over there. Blake beat up a cop right over there. We tried to hang Mikey over there! Just over there, I told everyone to be peaceful [jerk-off motion]. Such good memories—we should do this again.'” Jordan Klepper"
Jordan Klepper,"Today [SCOTUS] issued a ruling on the abortion pill, which religious activists asked them to ban on the legal grounds that they [checks notes] don’t like it."
Jordan Klepper,"Now to be clear, the court didn’t decide this case based on the merits, just on a technical issue of standing. So anti-abortion groups still have another chance to get the abortion pill banned. Which is nice to know that at least they get a Plan B."
Jordan Klepper,"Yes, obviously you can’t sue a drug just because you don’t want somebody else to use it. Like, I want cocaine to be less available to Don Jr. It doesn’t mean that I can sue cocaine."
Jordan Klepper,"It’s wild that they were inspired to do this because of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that everyone hated. That’s like if you ask a comedian why they got into stand-up and they say, ‘I loved Kramer’s set at the Laugh Factory.'"
Jordan Klepper,I think we just found his campaign slogan: Trump 2024—This Is What We’re Reduced To.
Jordan Klepper,"It’s nice to know that in a time where so much divides us, one thing that binds us all together in our shared humanity is looking up at the person we elected and sayin, ‘Man, f*ck that guy.'"
Jordan Klepper,"a horrible city”] “Hey! I may not be from Wisconsin but I am from Michigan, and let me just say, don’t mess with the Midwest, buddy. We will politely ask you to please stop and then thank you in advance and that’s a threat!"
Seth Meyers,"Seriously, do you people have no shame? It’s the guy’s first public visit since he sicced a mob on you and almost got you killed and and not only are you welcoming him back with open arms, you’re singing him ‘Happy Birthday’ a day before his birthday? This is like if all the teens at Crystal Lake got together throw a surprise party for Jason. ‘We got you a new chainsaw!'"
Seth Meyers,Although I will say it doesn’t surprise me that Republicans won the baseball game. They have a lot of speed on the base paths. Remember how fast Josh Hawley ran form the mob on January 6. He was like a MAGA Rickey Henderson.
Seth Meyers,"Senate Republicans yesterday blocked a Democratic bill that would have created new ethics rules for the Supreme Court, news that Clarence Thomas was pleased to hear when he pulled into port."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Oh, what a spineless little Mitch you are."
Jimmy Kimmel,[On a YouTuber Bible reviewer condemning Trump’s high-priced God Bless the USA Bible ] “We have a pastor saying he wished the Bible didn’t exist because of Donald Trump. That’s an accomplishment.

Stephen Colbert,"When the reports first came out, Thomas’ lawyers issued a statement calling them ‘untrue.’ Okay, but counterpoint… true."
Stephen Colbert,"Hey, no no no no, it wasn’t a lie, it was an inadvertent omission. ‘Oopsie-daisy, I guess there’s egg on my face. Because when I was at Bohemian Grove I ate the world’s last dodo egg at the omelette bar. And then drank a mimosa out of Geronimo’s skull.'"
Stephen Colbert,I love you” subject line was followed by a sales pitch for “RED MAGA HAT
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, here’s a little story from the future of tech—thanks to tech there is no future."
Stephen Colbert,"One expert on artificial intelligence predicted there’s a 99.9 percent chance of AI leading to human extinction within the next hundred years. Then again, AI advocates are quick to point out, ‘Check out this picture of Scooby-Doo making out with Ronald Reagan on a jet ski!'"
Stephen Colbert,"Starting this week, Apple announced that it’s starting to add a little AI to many of its core apps and devices, and they’re calling it Apple Intelligence. So much better than their previous operating system, Apple Dumbass."
Stephen Colbert,"No, uh-uh. No new emojis until we finish using all the ones we already have. I’m looking at you, small trolley with pantograph electrical connection, mountain cable car, and aerial tramway. ‘You up? Because I’m feelin’ aerial tramway.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The 2024 presidential election is fast approaching. As hard as it is to believe, in just five months the candidates will be even older."
Stephen Colbert,This Sunday is Father’s Day. It’s a lot like Mothers Day in that your mom organized the plans for both.
Stephen Colbert,"She tried her best. I mean, she begged. She even gave Trump puppy dog eyes. Literally, she sent him a box of puppy dog eyes."
Stephen Colbert,"Leading the Washington Post to change it’s slogan from ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness’ to to ‘Turn Off the Lights, Shhh, This Will Be Over Soon.'"
Stephen Colbert,Thats’ quite a string of bosses. In college he had an internship with the eyeball guy from Pan’s Labyrinth .
Jimmy Fallon,Tomorrow is Donald Trump’s 78th birthday. Down at Mar-a-Lago they’re planning a big party with candy ankle monitors and a bouncy courthouse.
Jimmy Fallon,"I saw a new study that said that the average social media user is part of 83 different group chats. So if you’re only in 82, that 83rd is talking smack about you."
