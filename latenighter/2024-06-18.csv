Jimmy Fallon,Trump bragged about passing one cognitive test while failing another.
Jimmy Fallon,"Hey, I heard about an 81-year-old woman in Boston who was just named the world’s oldest train driver. When he heard, Biden was like, ‘I have never been more turned on.'"
Jimmy Fallon,heat dome” hitting the Northeast] “It is brutal out there. People are sweating like Mike Pence watching the Tony Awards.
Jimmy Fallon,"They were making it look like they were working without actually working. Or, as most people call that, working."
Stephen Colbert,"‘I love Ronnie Johnson! Doc Ronnie, Doc Ronnie Johnson. He gave me the test and then I went home to my beautiful wife Malaria. And my two hideous sons Urkel and Carls Jr.'"
Stephen Colbert,"I’m no psychologist, but does Donald Trump… want to murder Mike Lindell?"
Stephen Colbert,rambling” like a “drunk uncle
Stephen Colbert,meandering” and “doesn’t know what he’s talking about
Stephen Colbert,This man is about to be in a world of deep-fried hurt.
Stephen Colbert,"In 2020 the Democratic convention was there, I made a few innocent jokes about it, and four years later I’m still legally barred from buying bratwurst."
Stephen Colbert,"crime” in Milwaukee was terrible] “Now, he does have a point. Milwaukee has become so soft on crime that this July their convention center is hosting a convicted felon."
Stephen Colbert,I hope everybody had a nice Father’s Day. I had brunch with my kids and then I went home and grilled a hammock with my new beard trimmer.
Stephen Colbert,"You heard him Trump folks, he doesn’t need your vote. You know what, on November 5, take a you day, MAGA-style. Go get your gun a mani-pedi. Maybe a couples’ massage with your truck. Yell at your kids’ teacher about how the Very Hungry Caterpillar transitions into a butterfly. Have fun!"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yeah, his name’s Ronny Jackson. It’s not Ronny Johnson, it’s Jackson. If that was another cognitive test, you failed it."
Jimmy Kimmel,I guess you’d be mad on Father’s Day if there was a a whole day dedicated to your biggest failures.
Jimmy Kimmel,It was such a disaster in the making Ted Cruz had already booked a flight to get away.
Jimmy Kimmel,All 15 Black Americans who support Trump were there to see Matin Luther Burger King in person.
Seth Meyers,Bragging about acing a cognitive test while forgetting the name of the doctor who gave it to you is like writing on a resume that you speak three languages and then misspelling the word languages.
Seth Meyers,"Imagine how hard it would be to find out that your dad was on Epstein’s light logs—and on Father’s Day, no less! What do you even write on the card after that? ‘To the best dad who hasn’t been on Epstein’s plane eight or more times! Love, Don Jr.'"
Seth Meyers,"‘I’m not on the Epstein list’ is one of those things that, if you have to say it, you’ve already lost. For example, even if it’s true, you wouldn’t put it on a dating profile between ‘outdoorsy’ and ‘loves dogs.'"
Seth Meyers,"Seven times! He wasn’t just on Epstein’s plane, he had Platinum Status. They let him board before uniformed military personnel. He was only three flights away from filling out his punch card."
Seth Meyers,"He short circuits when they ask him about Epstein like he’s Sylvester the cat and someone just asked him, ‘Have you seen Tweety Bird?'"
Seth Meyers,"23 pairs of twins recently graduated from the same middle school in Massachusetts. The graduation was held, I’m guessing, in the shadow of a nearby cooing tower."
Seth Meyers,"[After calling Republican fawning over Trump “weird”] “And by the way, I don’t mean to denigrate all types of weird. Artistic weird, for example, is great. Uncle weird, on the other hand, is not. Artistic weird is when you paint yourself blue and play the drums. Uncle weird is when you start carrying around loose Ivermectin in your Members Only jacket and tell everyone at Thanksgiving about the testicle tanner you bought because you saw it on Tucker Carlson’s web show.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"a list”] “You’re not on an FBI list. These guys are so desperate to pretend they’re anti-government rebels with transgressive views rather than the rich, powerful a**holes they are. Besides, the FBI doesn’t need to put Don Jr on a list. I’m pretty sure they know where to find him. Just check all stores that sell Adderall-infused beard oil."
Seth Meyers,"Tesla has reportedly paused Cybertruck deliveries due to an issue with their windshield wipers. Apparently, when you turn them on you can see all the people laughing at you."
Jon Stewart,Acing that cognitive test is a great point if only his doctor was actually named Ronny Johnson and not Ronny Jackson. He got the guy’s name wrong on his cognitive test. I don’t even know what to say.
Jon Stewart,"The sad thing, under MAGA law his name is now Ronny Johnson."
Jon Stewart,"feelings” to refute the FBI’s statistics on decreasing crime] “Yeah, as the right always famously says, ‘Feelings don’t care about your facts.’ ‘F**k your facts,’ isn’t that the slogan on the right?"
Jon Stewart,"But the point is, if you leave your house in New York, you will be shot dead. To all our audience members, I’m glad you chose to have your last moments with us."
Jon Stewart,"Now all of this, by the way, is not to say that gun crime does not exist. Of course it does! And some cities are worse than others. But here’s the thing—and I say this with all due respect—the balls of these right wing motherf**kers, talking about how there’s too much gun crime and chaos in our Democratic cities when Republicans are the ones who’ve enabled the flood of illegal weapons into our cities in the first place.” jon stewart"
Jon Stewart,"Here’s something you wanna know. 93 percent of the illegal guns used in crimes in New York City aren’t from here. They, like theater majors, have come here to make a name for themselves."
Jon Stewart,"The guns come from states like Georgia, and Florida, and South Carolina, where the gun laws are lax. And trust me, Florida is not sending us their best guns. They’re bringing guns for drugs, and crime, and rapists, and some I assume are good guns."
Jon Stewart,"And try as we might to put up some border controls to stem this invasion, this flood of literally undocumented weapons, Republicans fight every attempt to bring some type of order. And even paass laws to increase the chaos. [Stewart reads off GOP-led bans on everything from holding gun sellers and manufacturers responsible to terrorists and felons getting guns to allowing bump stocks.] Why would they do this? There must be a reason, right? The right tells us there’s no coincidences, right? Isn’t that what we’re told all the time? It’s almost as though Republicans must have a secret plan for this, funded by their billionaires. To flood our cities with illegal, undocumented guns. Pouring them over our state borders in the hopes of killing off reliable Democratic voters. The Great Displacement Theory, that’s obviously what’s happening, and no honest person would think otheriwise. So there’s only one real solution. Unfortunately for the borders of Gerogia, Florida, and South Carolina, we have to—what’s the word—[clip of Trump crowd chanting ‘Build That Wall!’] jon stewart"
Jon Stewart,"Just weeks before he heads to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, [Trump] called Milwaukee ‘a horrible city,’ forcing liberals around the country to defend Milwaukee, a city they then had to pretend that they’ve been to ."
Jon Stewart,"Yes, lots of crime in Milwaukee. Are you talking about now, sir, or when you and your felonious friends come to town?"
Jon Stewart,"bing, bang, bong” gun imitations] “I would pay good money to hear Trump describe the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan ."
