Seth Meyers,"How is it only two points?! The guy staged a month-long coup attempt and violent insurrection, got impeached twice, bungled a deadly pandemic so badly the nation’s top scientists tried to hide their faces, tried to take health care away from 20 million Americans, called the CEO of Apple Tim Apple, said he would use his presidency to get revenge on his enemies and be a dictator on day one, threw paper towels at hurricane victims and defaced a weather map, asked his audience if they’d rather die by shark bite or electrocution, just got convicted of 34 felony counts for paying hush money during a presidential campaign to a porn star who testified in court that she spanked him with a magazine with his face on it, and that he was wearing, and I quote, ‘silk or satin pajamas.’ Silk or satin pajamas? All else aside, he should be losing because he’s a huge dork. Who are you, Lauren Bacall?” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"‘Jacked-Up Joe’ sounds awesome. Jacked-Up Joe sounds like a professional wrestler. ‘Oooh brother, you’re gonna regret the day you tangled with Jacked-Up Joe!'"
Seth Meyers,"I mean, I guess because they’re not athletes and they’re not horses. I mean, should we also make them wear jock straps and eat oats from a big ol’ bag?"
Seth Meyers,Apparently they’ve been having a lot of trouble with kids coveting their neighbors’ oxen.
Seth Meyers,That was taken right after they ran over a kitten.
Seth Meyers,All you need is Trump.
Seth Meyers,Luckily residents in Texas were given a wanring when they saw Ted Cruz heading for the airport.
Stephen Colbert,"And best of all, that poll is from Fox News [Colbert appears in full Fox News gear] Wooo! Woo! Woo-woo! You know I’ve always loved you, Fox News! Fair and balanced reporting from America’s most trusted anchors. I go ham for Hannity! And I’m juicy for the Ducey."
Stephen Colbert,"See, his campaign’s not doomed. He’s just being followed around by a flock of black birds."
Stephen Colbert,Now this is controversial I understand that. But something had to be done to stop second graders from coveting their neighbors’ wives.
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, classroom walls are not supposed to have the Ten Commandments on them. They’re supposed to have times tables, and U.S. presidents, and a poster that’s been there since the ’90’s of Urkel saying, ‘When It Comes To Reading, I Did Do That.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The solstice is the longest day of the year as I said, and also the official start of summer. Which of course raises the question, what the hell has the last week been?"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, today celebrate the solstice, tomorrow celebrate the tetanus."
Stephen Colbert,"Look, I support climate action, and this makes me want to go buy a Hummer."
Stephen Colbert,Now this is not the first time a McDonald’s mascot has helped out the Mets. Back in 1986 the Hamburglar was their coke dealer.
Stephen Colbert,"[On a minor league baseball team selling cannabis-infused soft drinks at games] “Now, that might sound odd, but remember Coca Cola used to have cocaine in it, and ginger ale originally contained the blood of a redhead."
Jimmy Fallon,[Trump] hasn’t been this upset since McDonalds discontinued the McRib.
Jimmy Fallon,"Forget the debate, I say we put them both in a hammock and the first one who stands up is our next President."
Jimmy Fallon,"Finally, a way to remind kindergartners to stop committing adultery."
Jimmy Fallon,"Wait a minute, these last four brutal hellhole days have been spring?"
Jimmy Fallon,"Of course when it gets this hot, power outages usually happen. [Picture of Trump] And let’s face it, some people aren’t great with losing power."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, there’s a chance Trump will accept the nomination, but only if Americans will accept a collect call."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Biden has secluded himself at Camp David, where he’s preparing for this fight like he’s Rocky Balboa getting ready for Golf Clubber Lang. And Trump is hard at work right now deciding whether to go to with the scented Aqua Net or the unscented."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Despite skipping every other debate, Trump reportedly cannot wait to attack Joe Biden. It’s the most he’s ever hated someone he’s not married to."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Robert Kennedy Jr did not make the cut for the debate. Once again, he didn’t get a shot."
Jimmy Kimmel,Maybe they should also post the Constitution in the Louisiana governor’s office so he could give it a read once in a while.
Jimmy Kimmel,There’s no way this is the longest day of the year. Election Day will be the longest day of the year.
Desi Lydic,"Whoa guys, I appreciate the cause, but what what did Stonehenge ever do? I mean literally—what did Stonehenge do? I get the stone part, but what the f**k is a henge?"
Desi Lydic,"Regardless, I don’t think this helped the cause. I mean, all they did was make it look like Stonehenge went to town on some Doritos."
Desi Lydic,"These stunts don’t work. I promise you, Exxon saw this and said, ‘That’s a good point, I wonder if there’s oil under Stonehenge.'"
Ronny Chieng,"I don’t think painting Stonehenge orange is gonna do anything guys, okay? Last year, the sky in New York turned orange and we still didn’t care, okay? Everyone was like, ‘Aw, that’s weird, let’s turn up the air conditioning.'"
Ronny Chieng,"Guys, spray paint is not going to ground these planes, okay? You’ve gotta do something radical, like cut some wires, or install some Boeing parts."
Ronny Chieng,"You know when you’re in middle school and your two worst enemies have a sleepover and spend the whole night talking sh*t about you? Well, that just happened to America."
Ronny Chieng,Best friends forever! Russia and North Korea! They go together like vodka and famine.
Ronny Chieng,"Everyone wins! I mean, Russia gets North Korean weapons and North Korea gets… whatever Putin has. Those nesting dolls and Tucker Carlson’s phone number? I don’t know."
Ronny Chieng,"Now that Russia has North Korean weapons, watch out Ukraine! Get ready for missiles that blow up on the launching pad!"
