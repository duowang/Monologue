Seth Meyers,Your plan to calm fear about his age is an earlier bedtime? Are you hoping that we’ll forget he’s 81 if you treat him like he’s five and a half?
Seth Meyers,"Why is your mouth open? If you were at a carnival, a 12-year-old would try to shoot water into it."
Seth Meyers,No! That’s not what this is about. ‘Giving it your all’ is what salsa lessons at a retirement home is all about.
Seth Meyers,"This isn’t about how you feel, this is about how voters feel. If you truly believe that American democracy is at stake—and it is—then you have to act like it. You can’t claim to be the last bulwark against fascism and also have a ‘more sleep’ plan."
Seth Meyers,"Biden had a bad debate performance and Democrats are having a vigorous back and forth over whether he should stay in. Donald Trump fomented a violent coup attempt and was convicted of 34 felony counts and not only did every Republican immediately fall in line, they showed up at the courthouse in matching suits like they were flight attendants on MAGA Airlines."
Seth Meyers,"That’s right, they’re fighting a second American Revolution to outlaw abortion, make Trump a dictator, and ban pornography. It’s just like the first American Revolution, when Nathan Hale famously said, ‘I only regret that I have the one lifetime subscription to Ye Olde Jugs magazine. Which, to clarify, was just about regular jugs."
Seth Meyers,The only way you could get Trump to read about a plan to ban pornography is if you hid it inside some pornography.
Seth Meyers,His aides are involved and his super PAC is running ads on it. The only way Trump could be any more directly linked to Project 2025 is if he sold it as a companion piece with his bibles.
Seth Meyers,"I wish them well”] “It’s like in WWII when Churchill famously said, ‘We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the seas, we shall hope the best man wins.'"
Seth Meyers,"I’d hate to see Trump in a monster movie. ‘Godzilla, he’s rampaging through the city, destroying buildings—he’s killing our citizens and we wish him luck."
Seth Meyers,"The bar for campaign promises has really been lowered. It used to be stuff like, ‘I will safeguard Social Security,’ or ‘I will create jobs.’ Now we’re down to, ‘I won’t eat you.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Whatever is in Dark Brandon Secret Sauce, evidently, Joe Biden chose to drink it out of that chalice from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade . He chose poorly."
Stephen Colbert,I think Biden debates as well as about Lincoln… if you dug him up right now.
Stephen Colbert,"You work for Joe Biden, why do you even own pale makeup? He’s already an 81-year-old Irishman, he’s f**king translucent."
Stephen Colbert,"I hate those summer colds, where your voice gets hoarse and your brain explodes."
Stephen Colbert,"Going into it, all Joe had to do was to allay people’s fears that he was too old. But instead, Biden’s shakiness allowed Trump to get away with 90 minutes of lies, racism, and weird golf brags."
Stephen Colbert,Actually I don’t think that’s ‘what this is about.’ I think thats what The Karate Kid was about.
Stephen Colbert,"bad episode”] “Wrong! When Grey’s Anatomy did a musical, that was a bad episode. This took a year off my life."
Jimmy Fallon,"If I had to describe President Biden’s performance in fireworks terms, he was either the one that doesn’t ignite or the one where the bottle tips over and blows up your house."
Jimmy Fallon,"A growing number of Democrats want Biden to drop out. If he doesn’t, their only plan is to tie a bunch of balloons to the White House and hope he floats away like the old guy from Up ."
Jimmy Fallon,The media has spent almost two weeks calling on a candidate to drop out of the race and somehow it’s not the convicted felon.
Jimmy Fallon,Some high-profile Democrats like Rob Reiner and Stephen King also want Biden to drop out. You know things are bad when the guys behind Stand By Me won’t stand by you.
Jimmy Fallon,"Biden’s brushing everyone off. He’s like, ‘People have been telling me not to run for President since 1988. I think I know what I’m doing.'"
Jimmy Fallon,There’s nothing like watching a fireworks show and then watching your uncles high-three each other.
Jimmy Fallon,"Its pretty nuch a reverse Olympics. First you get the gold, then you do the 100-meter dash to the bathroom."
Jon Stewart,"Rather than respecting the American people and having an honest, at least partial conversation about what we had all seen, we were told immediately, ‘These are not the droids you’re looking for.'"
Jon Stewart,The difference is this. Trump delivered at the debate to expectation. We expect him to be f**king crazy.
Jon Stewart,"That’s not what this is about! There are no participation trophies in end-game democracy. I remember FDR saying, ‘Well, if the Nazis take over Europe, at least both teams had fun.'"
Jon Stewart,drop out” crowd of being “bedwetters
Jon Stewart,"Four months is for-f**king-ever. Britain just held and election in two months. France had two in one month, defeated fascism, and still had time to have an affair with Denmark."
Jon Stewart,Biden ran against Dean Phillips. That’s not even a real person That’s a stock photo on the package for a garden hose.
Unknown,"Okay, here’s the thing. I would vote for a skeleton over Donald Trump. In fact, I may literally be voting for a skeleton over Donald Trump."
Unknown,This might be the first presidential race where a slick bathtub could alter the course of history.
