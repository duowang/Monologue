Seth Meyers,"Oh my God, Democrats, get your sh*t together. There’s four months left to go and you’re already admitting defeat and holding a funeral? This is like a football coach giving a halftime speech that ends with, “Clear eyes, full hearts, we’re gonna get f**king crushed!"
Seth Meyers,"No one cares how sad you guys are. Democracy is on the line. A pathological megalomaniac is currently leading in the polls, and if he wins you won’t be able to distract yourself by looking at porn because it will be banned. Even the softcore stuff on Instagram, that’s right. They’re comin’ for side-boob!"
Seth Meyers,"You guys are talking about him the way disappointed parents talk about a college student’s major. “I mean, I wish he was pre-med, but he fell in love with improv and it’s my job as a parent to say…’Yes, and.'"
Seth Meyers,"Conservatives want to wage a full scale assault on reproductive rights by, among other things, banning emergency contraception and the abortion pill and renaming the Department of Health and Human Services the Department of Life. Which is ironic given that supporters of this plan all look like they were mummified, like 500 years ago. And their candidate looks like a Madame Toussaud’s wax figure after it was fished out of the East River.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"So moving forward, if you want to see a porn star naked, you’ll have to do it the way God intended, by having sex with one during your third marriage."
Seth Meyers,"Also, I love when he says he knows enough about the plan to disagree with it, but also claims he has no idea who’s behind it. You could just Google it, you know? Then you’d see that the people behind it are all a bunch of cadavers who worked for you."
Seth Meyers,"Surely he remembers Stephen Miller. I mean, how could you forget? That’s like watching the Quiet Place prequel and not immediately recognizing the monsters."
Seth Meyers,"Okay first of all, it’s not a good insult to say that a straw sucks. That’s like fully what they’re supposed to do. That’s like saying a trombone blows or a dung beetle eats sh*t."
Jordan Klepper,"Keep in mind, Biden has said about 50 times that he’s staying in the race. He’s like, ‘I’m not going anywhere. The Lord Almighty couldn’t get me out of this race.’ And Pelosi’s going, ‘Yep, great. Just let us know when you decide.'"
Jordan Klepper,"I mean, that’s the same energy my mom had when I told her I was gong into comedy. She still calls me today like, ‘Have you made a decision about medical school yet?'"
Jordan Klepper,"If you missed Donald Trump’s rally yesterday, he had very important things to say, like Biden sucks at golf, Chris Christie is fat, and and once I saw a hot waitress."
Jordan Klepper,"Wow, what a smooth transition from, ‘There’s blood in the streets!’ to ‘And why do I have to check my bags at the gate?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"I’m not saying things are chaotic, but right now Biden’s campaign office seems like the kitchen on The Bear ."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, Democrats are torn between breaking up with their guy or just riding it out. Melania was like, ‘I know that feeling.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump said if Biden beats him he’d give a million dollars to charity. Keep in mind, Charity is the name of a dancer at a club near Mar-a-Lago."
Desi Lydic,"Okay again, less an argument and more a statement of fact. It’s like if your mother-in-law asked if you liked the dinner she made and you say, ‘You made a dinner. And it was food. And I will eat the food until there is other food.'"
Desi Lydic,"Yeah, you know you’re in trouble when even Danny Ocean is saying, ‘We can’t pull this one off.'"
Desi Lydic,"Last month, he helped raise 30 million dollars for Joe Biden. Wait, while we were all distracted by this op-ed, who was watching the money? Awww, it was a heist the whole time—Cloooney!!"
Desi Lydic,It’s the first time I ever heard Trump talk about a woman’s inner beauty. Maybe he’s maturing—either that or he thinks there are more boobs to find on the inside.
Desi Lydic,They’re killing us with fentanyl and I’m in boarding group 6?
Stephen Colbert,"While congressional Democrats are conflicted, we got a clear message today from our nation’s more powerful Democratic leaders—George Clooney."
Stephen Colbert,"George wrote a New York Times op-ed titled, ‘I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee,’ adding, ‘We also need a money guy, a safecracker, an acrobat, and Brad Pitt. It’s the plot of Ocean’s 24: Amal’s Busy With Human Rights Stuff and I Got Bored ."
Stephen Colbert,Project 2025 sounds like the name of a government research project than accidentally creates mushroom zombies.
Stephen Colbert,"That certainly inspires confidence. It’s like a surgeon saying, ‘Uh, to be honest Mr. Hendricks, before this morning I didn’t really know what the heart even was. But, you know, I watched a YouTube video and figured it out in like two minutes. So what do you say you go sleepy-bye and I scoop out the squishy-pumpy thing.'"
Stephen Colbert,in charge” of elections under a second Trump term] “In charge? He’s the biggest election denier of all time. Thats like making E. coli the manager of the salad bar.
Stephen Colbert,"And here’s the thing, let’s hold the election right now, okay?"
Unknown,"Ten strokes, that’s nine more than he lasted with Stormy."
Unknown,"This is my last night hosting the show. And if Donald Trump becomes President again, it might be the last time a woman over 40 is allowed to appear on national television."
Unknown,"Taco Bell is launching what they’re calling an early retirement community in San Diego. It’s called the Cantinas. Finally we can die the way we lived, with a crunchwrap supreme pouring out of our anuses."
