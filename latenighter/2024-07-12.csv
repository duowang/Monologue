name,monologue
Seth Meyers,"It should be just another exchange with reporters, but instead it’s become the single most highly anticipated press conference since the Beatles landed in America. And Joe Biden, also there."
Seth Meyers,"NBC News anchor Lester Holt is set next week to interview President Biden. But if Biden really wants to prove he can beat Trump, he needs to go on Hot Ones ."
Seth Meyers,"President Biden this week tweeted ‘Google Project 2025’ in an attempt to warn voters about the risk of a second Trump term. And look, I know that Biden is old and out of touch, but it’s at least reassuring that he didn’t tell us to Ask Jeeves."
Seth Meyers,"Yeah, no, I wonder could it have been a thoroughly tested vaccine that saved millions of lives and was subjected to rigorous safety trials by the world’s most renowned scientists? Or could it have been, I don’t know, the march of time?"
Seth Meyers,"So Joe Biden slashed the number of low wage workers by more than half, or, as the New York Times probably wrote, ‘Wages Rise, Much Like Biden’s Elderly Age.'"
Seth Meyers,high stakes”] “Are they talking about the President answering some questions or is David Blaine burying himself in a coffin full of clam chowder?
Seth Meyers,"That’s right, Biden’s team said he had a cold, to which I say, which Sudafed did you give him? Next time get him the good stuff, and I mean the good stuff. The stuff they make the meth out of, the stuff you have to ask the pharmacist for and they look at your driver’s license twice and you take it and it immediately dries out your nose and your mouth and every other part of your body and your mind starts racing like you just snorted a line of cocaine mixed with LSD in emergency and you feel like you’re invincible. But also you’re hallucinating and the next thing you know, you wake up in a hotel in Thailand with duct tape over your mouth and the cops are bangin’ on your door and then you glance over at your TV and you say, ‘Whoa, am I tripping balls or is that a news story about Lauren Boebert giving a handy to someone during Beetlejuice ?'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"go back to TV”] “Honestly, I could say the same to you. NBC could use both of you back."
Seth Meyers,Former President Trump is discussing plans which would reduce the sharing of U.S. intelligence with NATO. [Photo of the classified document dump in Trump’s golf resort restroom] Which I guess means just not letting them use the bathroom?
Seth Meyers,"Woo, strong language. Be sure to read the other op-ed, ‘Battery Acid: Unpleasant to Drink.'"
Seth Meyers,"It doesn’t surprise me that Trump had no idea what NATO was. He probably thought it had something to do with sharks. ‘You have to keep the -nado away from the shark, because the shark is bad enough but when they combine, now you have a real problem because now it’s weather. I remember a shark came up to me once—big shark, strong shark—tears pouring from his dead, soulless eyes, and I said, ‘You remind me of Stephen Miller,’ and he said, ‘He’s my cousin.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"So if any of you kids wanna go to Disney, you know what you gotta do."
Jimmy Fallon,"The whispers about Biden dropping out of the race are getting louder. They’re getting so loud, Biden can almost hear them."
Jimmy Fallon,Biden hasn’t seen this many people jump ship since he took that vacation on the Titanic.
Jimmy Fallon,"Honestly, show some class. Do what I do and wait until the Little League World Series."
Jimmy Kimmel,Biden’s conference today was a big deal because it was unscripted. Like the whole country got invited to our grandpa’s level one improv class.
Stephen Colbert,That is some weapons-grade passive aggression.
Stephen Colbert,"It’s 7/11, which is, of course, National Slurpee Day. But ever since the debate, a lot of people have been taking Big Gulps."
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, fair enough. But most people would leave early too if they knew they were going home with George Clooney."
Stephen Colbert,"Plus, George Clooney is really busy. He’s gotta leave. [Photo of Clooney’s Batman and Robin suit] He’s out protecting Gotham City as Nipple Man."
Stephen Colbert,That’s the Batman movie where his parents were murdered in a drive-by nurpling.
Stephen Colbert,"The New York Times published a big editorial called, ‘Donald Trump Is Unfit to Lead.’ It’s the follow-up to their editorial, ‘Gonorrhea Is Unfun to Have.'"
Stephen Colbert,‘Cause nothing says summer fun like the words ‘North Korea’ and ‘camp.'
Stephen Colbert,"I’ve got a major story out of China, where a man was stopped at customs with 100 live snakes down his pants. Reminds me of the old joke, ‘Is that a hundred snakes down your pants, or are you just so happy to see me that you’re writhing in pain as limbless reptiles savage your nards?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Speaking of airports, there’s an update from Boeing. You know their slogan: Your plane’s a convertible now.'"
Unknown,"Whenever Biden speaks, it’s like I’m a stage mom at her six-year-old’s commercial audition and I’m watching from the sidelines. Like, ‘C’mon honey, you’ve got this! We need you to land this job so we can keep our health insurance and keep my family out of concentration camps.'"
Unknown,"I’m sorry, movies never really worked out for George Clooney? The world famous mega movie star? His movies have more than 3.5 billion dollars at the box office. You know who movies never worked out for? Donald Trump. A man who somehow blew a one second cameo in Home Alone 2 ."
Unknown,"Trump also sh*t the bed so badly in the 1994 Little Rascals movie in the role of ‘Waldo’s dad’ that this is the first time you’re hearing of it. That’s right, he killed the Little Rascals franchise like it knew the details of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein."
Unknown,"Of course, the big difference between George Clooney and Donald Trump is that George Clooney actually made money from a casino."
Unknown,What a super chill time to be doing a topical monologue on national television. Just sharing your personal opinions with millions of people. I feel like right now I could come out in favor of ranch dressing and it would still end my career.
Unknown,Serious question: should humans be ingesting something with the words ‘slur’ and ‘pee’ in the name?
Unknown,"If you’re not familiar with the rules of cricket, it’s a lot like baseball, except… do we have three hours? No?"
Unknown,"According to a study from the University of Southern California, 70 percent of people rated jokes written by Chat GPT as funnier than those written by regular people. I mean, I kind of believe it. I can think of 50 people off the top of my head who aren’t as funny as a robot and some of them have Netflix specials."
Unknown,"A.I. might be capable of writing jokes, but only a comedian can cry in their used Kia Sportage full of unsold merch after a disastrous set at Flappers in Burbank."
