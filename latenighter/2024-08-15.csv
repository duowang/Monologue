Desi Lydic,"Okay, now I’m suspicious. ‘Cause the last time Trump said ‘I don’t know anything about that,’ he was talking about Stormy Daniels. So, did Trump f**k project 2025?"
Desi Lydic,These are internal training videos for people who want to join a new Trump government in the hopes of someday being kicked off Dancing With the Stars .
Desi Lydic,"Oh my God, is every sentence gonna be like this? ‘I’m sitting in a chair, or as the left would call it, a quad leg-abled, up-cycled, non-binary, wood-based booty ally.'"
Desi Lydic,"No, no I don’t. I don’t think of population control when I think of climate change, you weirdo. I think of forest fires and Smokey Bear and his tight little bear bod, like a normal American woman."
Desi Lydic,"This video might actually bring Project 2025 to a screeching halt, because I don’t care how badly you want to ban abortion, if you have to physically meet someone for coffee to do that, ugh, f**k it, let ‘em have their rights."
Desi Lydic,Anyone would remember meeting this guy. You’re telling me [Trump]’s got a nickname for Joe Biden but not libertarian Gandalf?
Desi Lydic,"So this guy worked in the Trump administration. Can you imagine how often Mike Pence tried to confess to him? ‘Father, today I saw a pear and had impure thoughts.'"
Desi Lydic,"If there’s one thing we know about Donald Trump, it’s that he’s not a policy guy. He’s more of a boobs guy. Or a ‘She’ll have a salad’ guy. Or a ‘Babe, I swear I have a latex allergy’ guy."
Stephen Colbert,"f**king cowards” for not signing their names] “That is a press secretary apparently unfamiliar with the concept of a press release. ‘And now Pringles released a statement saying once I pop, I am not going to be able to stop, but they don’t put anyone’s name on it? Does Mr. Pringles even exist, or is he A.I., too? Hey Pringle, meet me in the alley after work, you high-sodium cuck!'"
Stephen Colbert,Must be your sh*tty hearing. Get your ears checked out.
Stephen Colbert,"Whereas, no matter who the audience is, JD Vance is always a sweaty weirdo who it’s easy to believe boned a La-Z-Boy."
Stephen Colbert,"A damning report links J.D. Vance to horrific work conditions. Those conditions, working with J.D. Vance."
Stephen Colbert,"Uh, maybe you should be. ‘He hugs my wife, says she’s so beautiful, and they’re taking a salsa dancing class together. Just yesterday he said to me, ‘Hey J.D., why don’t you go buy me and your wife some chicken wings and take your time, no rush coming back.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Not everyone is as big a fan of how Trump is running his campaign. Take former Trump critic, turned Trump ally, turned Trump critic, turned Trump ally, turned Trump critic, Nikki Haley."
Seth Meyers,Since when does a cellphone make you sound like your dentures are banging against your tongue?
Seth Meyers,Former Vice President Mike Pence said in a recent interview that he cannot endorse former President Trump because Trump wanted him to overturn the 2020 election. And he can’t endorse Kamala Harris because that’s third base and he’s married.
Seth Meyers,"I love when news organizations use words to describe Trump that Trump has definitely never used. ‘My shift in fortunes has been a real whipsaw. My current position is precarious and I am quite perturbed.’ In reality, all he’s saying is ‘F**k, f**k, f**k, f**k, f**k, f**k.'"
Seth Meyers,"By the way, Trump definitely thinks they’re coming from insane asylums because he heard they were seeking asylum and inside his smooth, chug-a-lug brain, he doesn’t have room for the idea that a word can mean two things."
Seth Meyers,"epic”] “Oh my God, they sound like eighth graders watching skateboard fails on YouTube."
Seth Meyers,"By the way, I know it’s supposedly called X now, but f**k him, it’s Twitter."
Seth Meyers,"In a new interview, former Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley said that former President Trump needs to make a serious shift and ‘quit whining about Vice President Kamal Harris.’ And Trump must have listened, because now he’s whining about Nikki Haley."
Seth Meyers,"We missed the RFK bear story when we were on our Olympics break and we haven’t had time to circle back to it. And we’re not going to circle back to it. Too much is happening. But that’s how wild the last three weeks have been. A Kennedy running for president picked up a bear carcass off the road so he could skin it and keep it in his refrigerator and then he put it in the trunk of his car and brought it to dinner at Peter Luger’s steakhouse, dumped the carcass in Central Park, and staged it to look like a bicycle accident causing a police investigation and media frenzy that led to a decade-long mystery, all because he forgot he had a flight to catch and didn’t have time to take the dead bear home. Although I don’t know why he didn’t just try to stuff it in the overhead compartment, because that’s not any weirder than what he actually did. And the only reason why we found out about any of this is because he confessed to Roseanne Barr, who was as shocked as the rest of us. Anyway, like I said, we don’t have time to circle back to it.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"The Bank of England has raised more than one million dollars for several British charaties by auctioning off some of the first bank notes to feature King Charles, who’s also a British charity."
Seth Meyers,"Former President Trump has supposedly decided to return to the social media platform X as a strategic move to fight his sinking poll numbers. All right, but it’s not what it used to be, dude. That’s like going back to your high school and finding out it’s a Big Lots now."
Jimmy Fallon,"According to a new report, former President Trump is furious at his campaign staff for letting him make the ‘terrible’ decision of picking J.D. Vance as his VP. Trump regrets pairing up with Vance. He’s like, ‘This is always why I sign a pre-nup.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Ahead of the Democratic National Convention, Kamal Harris and Tim Walz are taking a bus tour together through Pennsylvania. Yeah, and this is interesting, it’s the same bus that Democrats threw President Biden under."
Jimmy Kimmel,"According to a new study, cigarette smoking in America is the lowest that it’s been in 80 years. The study was funded by the world-renowned Institute of Vaping Is Actually Healthy and Cool as Hell."
