Seth Meyers,"Does he really not know the plural of ‘child?’ Is that because he pretends he only has the one? ‘This is my only child, Ivanka. And these are her assistants, Don and Igor.'"
Seth Meyers,"That makes sense, because if you’ve ever been to a school nurse’s office, you know they have Band-Aids, thermometers, and al the medical equipment necessary to do a gender-reassignment surgery."
Seth Meyers,"Yeah, I’d agree that’s not the proper tone right there. He looks less like a presidential candidate and more like a serial killer taunting the police. ‘Chief, yeah, it’s the Thumbs-Up Killer again.'"
Seth Meyers,"According to newly released rules from ABC, the upcoming presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump will not have an audience. [Shows picture of Melania Trump] Well, at least now she can pretend she was gonna go."
Seth Meyers,Those firefighters were booing him like he just said the best toy for kids was a pack of matches.
Seth Meyers,"Usually firefighters are only that mad the third time in a week they have to get Ms. Callahan’s cat out of the tree. ‘You should keep her inside, ma’am.’ ‘She likes the outdoors.’ ‘Maybe she just don’t like you!'"
Seth Meyers,"During a speech at a firefighters union conference in Boston this week, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance spoke about his past experience calling 911. Apparently he once saw a woman with no kids . ‘No, she is of child-bearing age. Just get here fast!'"
Seth Meyers,"Even crazier, it died after falling out after an eighth story window ."
Seth Meyers,"So now the world’s most overdue book is this guy’s. [Shows picture of George R.R. Martin] You can do it, George, I believe in you!"
Jimmy Kimmel,You know you’re a great dad when you think children are called ‘childs.'
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know, for a normal person it would have taken a lifetime to say that many stupid things in public. Trump did it in two months. Congratulations to him."
Jimmy Kimmel,nasty” for the way she treated then-VP Mike Pence] “You sent an army of toothless goons to hang him! And then sat back and watched it on TV.
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s exactly how it works. I know a couple, very nice couple, they had three boys, Greg, Bobby and Peter. One day they sent them to school, a few nights later they come home, Jan, Marcia, and Cindy, they’re girls now."
Jimmy Kimmel,He has finally arrived at the exact intersection of QVC and QAnon.
Jimmy Kimmel,"[Walz] is beautiful. His blood type is corn dog batter. He belongs to several pickle of the month clubs. Tim Walz is the type of guy who, if you sat next to him, he’d ask, ‘What brings you to Tampa?’ because he genuinely want to know what brings you to Tampa. J.D. Vance would just sit there watching you sleep, you know?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"If Trump loses this election, he’s gonna sue his son to take the Jr. away."
Jimmy Kimmel,"For a guy who wears more eyeliner than Liza Minnelli, you’d think he’d have a better understanding of women.a’ jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,J.D. Vance looks like someone asked A.I. to make the Two and a Half Men one person.
Jimmy Kimmel,Which is as beautiful as it is ridiculous.
Stephen Colbert,"Know what I mean?,” about whether immigrants are becoming too easily “acclimented"
Stephen Colbert,"‘These English professors, they stand up on the desk and they say, ‘O Captain, my Captain.’ And at first, me and Ethan Hawke are kind of rebels, we don’t want to do the reading. But in the end, we really like Robin Williams. We miss you, Mork, nanu-nanu. Mrs. Doubtfire . Good Morning Vietnam . Night at the Museum . Aladdin . Acclimented. And we’re back, it’s the weave.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, ‘acclimtented,’ I understand. I think that’s when you get acclimated to Trump being demented."
Stephen Colbert,He dances like an undercover cop at a gay bar.
Stephen Colbert,"That cannot be the way that his campaign folks wanted to change the narrative. ‘Sir, we need to get you back in the spotlight.’ ‘What about a crime?’ ‘Any other ideas?’ ‘We could do a crime.’ ‘No, sir.’ ‘We could visit a cemetery full of our nation’s war heroes…’ ‘Oh, that’s a great idea.’ ‘And commit a crime.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Now, in Trumps defense, he was respectful in the Arlington Cemetery pictures, offering his most solemn big old thumbs-up."
Stephen Colbert,Pushing an Arlington Cemetery worker is one of the least presidential things you can do. Tied with giving a bald eagle a wedgie at Gettysburg.

Stephen Colbert,"‘An official rebuke, some say that’s better than the Medal of Honor .'"

Stephen Colbert,"Because of the Electoral College, the election could come down to just seven states. Yes, it’s gonna come down to Michigan Wisconsin, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."
Stephen Colbert,"One reporter describes the seven state race as the equivalent of ‘a knife fight in a phone booth.’] Wow. See, a knife fight in a phone booth is notoriously difficult because it involves close quarters. And finding a phone booth."
Stephen Colbert,48 percent! That really restores my faith in nearly half of humanity.
Stephen Colbert,"kick into full gear”] “That’s right, the last two years of watching Trump campaign have just been an appetizer. Or as they say in France, an amuse-douche ."
Stephen Colbert,"Harris is particularly popular with women, while Trump is ahead among men, leading some to call this the ‘boys versus girls’ election. And remember, many Trump voters are not vaccinated against cooties."
Stephen Colbert,"Which means that, this Thanksgiving, your crazy uncle and your racist uncle will have plenty to bond over."
Stephen Colbert,"It reminds me of the first line of Moby Dick , ‘What the f**k?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Not a great sign when the least unhinged part of a sentence is, ‘excitedly bounded down to the beach, chainsaw in hand.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, that sounds weird. But it is the best way to make sure the rotting whale juice only goes in your mouth."
Stephen Colbert,"It’s the day after Labor Day, which means we’re in the fall. Referring to either Autumn or ‘of democracy.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump heard the news and was like, ‘Was it everything I said?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, she wants to rattle Trump. Right now she’s deciding whether to wear a jacket that says IRS or FBI."

Jimmy Fallon,"Netflix was like, ‘If you like this, you might enjoy Bridgerton .'"
