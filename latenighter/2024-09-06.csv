Seth Meyers,"‘You might not like me, you might even hate me. You might despise me so much that the sound of my voice haunts your nightmares and the sight of my grotesque, leathery face fills you with an all-consuming, incandescent rage that burns so deeply within the recesses of your soul that it fills you with, every waking moment, thoughts of bitterness and contempt, and when you see my ghastly countenance on television, you howl in pain. You howl like Ahab grappling to the last with his nemesis the whale. ‘From hell’s heart, I stab thee,’ you say, ‘for hate’s sake, I spit my last breath at thee!’ But still, you gotta vote for me.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"During last night’s town hall, Donald Trump criticized ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos and said that his interview with President Biden was ‘the softest interview I’ve ever seen.’ You’re gonna say that while you’re being interviewed by Sean Hannity? I ask tougher questions when John Oliver is here."
Seth Meyers,"In a Fox News town hall last night, former President Trump said the word ‘weird’ eleven times in about 30 seconds. Good thing he stopped at 11, because 12 times would have summoned J.D. Vance to the stage."
Seth Meyers,"running around” the Fox News studio] “And what do you mean they’re ‘running around?’ Mosquitoes are running arou—he can’t even talk about mosquitoes in a normal way. ‘You know the worst thing about these mosquitos running around, is you can’t hear their tiny footsteps. That’s why we need a wall made of citronella. And we’re gonna make the mosquitoes pay for it.'"
Seth Meyers,"First of all, the opposite of ‘weird’ isn’t ‘solid,’ it’s ‘normal.’ That’s something you might know if you weren’t—and I wish there were a better word for this—f**king weird."
Seth Meyers,"Second, just blurting out, ‘We’re not weird guys!,’ isn’t doing the work you think it is. It wasn’t even the question, nobody said anything about weird. Can you imagine Trump as a contestant on Family Feud . ‘Top five answers are on the board: Name something you bring to a party.’ [Buzzes in] ‘A parakeet, a Ziploc bag full of pills, a rubber dog turd, I’m not weird.'"
Seth Meyers,"It f**king took both of them working together. He’s the former President hoping to be the next President, they treated him like a customer on QVC who can’t make up their mind."
Seth Meyers,"Former President Trump said in an interview yesterday that his son Barron has enrolled at New York University and added, ‘He has a very high-aptitude child but he’s no longer a child. He’s just passed into something beyond child-dom.’ I think the word you’re looking for is ‘adulthood.’ And the other word you’re looking for is ‘childhood.’ And the other word you’re looking for is ‘Barron.'"
Seth Meyers,I had such second-hand embarrassment watching that that I had to peer through my hands like it was a Saw movie. This dude orders donuts like his kidnapper’s watching him from the car.
Seth Meyers,"And I love how, unprompted, he immediately just throws Vance under the bus. ‘Mr. President, how would you solve inflation?’ ‘Well, you know everyone is saying that J.D. is a very weird man, you know. He’s obsessed with childless women and he can’t even order donuts without creeping everybody out, but I don’t think he’s weird. Solid rock!'"
Seth Meyers,Man. that’s gonna be awfully hard on Trump. I give him about 10 minutes before he starts holding up signs like Wile E. Coyote.
Seth Meyers,"McDonald’s has announced it is adding a mini-McFlurry to its menu. The way it works is, the machine is still broken, but you’re a little less disappointed."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tonight was night two of Trump’s Fox News clown hall. Sean Hannity, he gave Trump another vigorous Hannity job as only he can."

Jimmy Kimmel,"Next week’s the debate which will be held here on ABC between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. ABC News released the agreed-upon rules for Tuesday’s duel. Each candidate will be given a pen, a pad of paper, a bottle of water, and a knife, and that’s it."
Jimmy Kimmel,"There will be no audience, but afterwards Trump will claim there were 30 thousand people chanting his name."
Jimmy Kimmel,"the worst network”] “And I just want to say, as somebody who has worked at ABC for over two decades, thank you. I feel like I played a part in making us the worst network."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump’s lawyers entered a plea of Not Guilty, But Even if I Am Guilty It’s Not a Crime Because I Can Do Whatever I Want."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The case was supposed to go to trial back in March, but the legal system, our legal system, works in mysterious ways when the defendant personally picked three of the judges on the Supreme Court."
Jimmy Kimmel,"‘Mister Pence, show us on the doll where the former President wanted to hang you.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yeah, I can’t imagine anyone in New Hampshire voting for Biden. You know why? Because he’s not on the ballot any more. ‘I can’t imagine anyone in New Hampshire voting for my opponent, the late, great Toucan Sam. Toucan Hussein Sam.'"
Stephen Colbert,weird” thing by promising that both he and Veep pick J.D. Vance are “solid rock
Stephen Colbert,"[After a donut shop worker responded to Vance explaining that he’s running for Vice President with an unimpressed, “Okay”] “I’m guessing not the response he was expecting. ‘I wrote a best selling book.’ ‘Okay.’ ‘They made it into a movie.’ ‘Okay.’ ‘Anyway, now I’m doing this and I’m starting to worry that, outside of my conservative bubble, most folks are Instantly repulsed by my personality, but at this point I’ve hitched my wagon to a man I hate and I’m concerned we’ll not only lose the election but I’ll lose any sense of who I am.’ ‘Okay. So, um, you want a donut?'” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,‘How long have I been in this donut shop? Forever? Okay.'
Stephen Colbert,"Whatever makes sense? They’re donuts, they all make equal sense, which is none. They’re a breakfast that is dessert. Eat any of them and you’ll feel full and starving."
Stephen Colbert,"Damn. Let me ask you a question, is J.D. Vance a donut? Because Tim Walz is dunking him."
Stephen Colbert,"He grabbed that woman’s fist bump. ‘Ah the female has presented her fist, I know this one. Paper covers rock, man covers woman, woman bears child. Human interaction complete.'"
Stephen Colbert,"To figure out who gets which podium and which one goes first or last, they flipped a coin, and Trump won the coin toss. Thank God. Otherwise we’d have to listen to months of coin denial."
Stephen Colbert,"Wait, Tim Walz has a right-wing brother who posts on Facebook? He is the most relatable man in America."
Stephen Colbert,"Tim Walz used to throw up in the car? That can only mean one thing, Tim Walz used to be… a child!"
Stephen Colbert,"Wow, that sounds really bad, because up until now, Tim Walz’s biggest scandal is that one time when it was raining and he didn’t say, ‘Well, we needed it.’ stephen colbert"
Jimmy Fallon,"They flipped a coin to determine who would speak last and Trump won the coin flip. Or as Trump put it, ‘I won the debate.'"
