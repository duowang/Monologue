I mean, what did I even say, you guys? I was waiting for one of you to cut me off and then I remembered it wasn’t a debate and I was like, ‘Uh oh, buckle up everybody.’ I mean, what a good question. And you all just had to sit here for it the whole time. You know, I shouldn’t say this, but at one point I blacked out. And when I came to, I opened my eyes—true story—and I was floating over the stage. And I could see—I looked down, I could see myself still answering the question, and I thought, ‘Well, I can’t be dead because I’m down there,’ but like, what in the world is going on right now. Ser[iously]—good question.'” seth meyers"
