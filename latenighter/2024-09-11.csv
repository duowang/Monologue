Jimmy Kimmel,It was a much better debate than the last debate. This was like in The Lion King when Simba came back to avenge Mufasa.
Jimmy Kimmel,Kamala was pushing his buttons like a 12-year-old playing Fortnite .
Jimmy Kimmel,It was like watching the Lorax debate the Grinch tonight.
Jimmy Kimmel,Usually when Donald Trump gets a spanking from a woman it’s with a Forbes magazine.
Jimmy Kimmel,Here’s what I’d like you to do right now. I want you to imagine we’ve never heard of Donald Trump before. And the first time you’ve ever seen him was during tonight’s debate. What would your reaction be? You’d be shocked. The Republican Party would have to close their headquarters and turn them into a Spirit Halloween store.
Jimmy Kimmel,Joe Biden is gonna be so happy tomorrow when he wakes up and watches this.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I can imagine Trump grabbing two pussies at once, I just can’t imagine him running."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He sees people on television. You know what else he sees on television, he sees Steve Harvey. He sees families having feuds. ‘These feuds would never happen if I was president, that I can tell you.’"
Jimmy Kimmel,"[On Vance’s not-at-all apology that he was only repeating what anonymous constituent calls were telling him (and urging Republicans to keep circulating his lie)] “Oh, he’s getting calls. I didn’t know he was getting calls, now it makes sense. I guess all you have to do to get J.D. Vance to start spreading crazy things about is to make calls. This by the way is the direct line to his office [flashes graphic], (202) 224-3353. Whatever you do, do not call that number to tell J.D. Vance that [flashes graphic] rainbow sprinkles at Baskin-Robbins turned your kids gay, okay?” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"How is it possible that half of this country thinks that it’s a good idea to give the guy who tried to overthrow our government another chance to run our government. If someone poisoned all the jalapeño poppers at TGI Fridays, you wouldn’t interview him to be the chef."
Jimmy Kimmel,Dick Cheney isn’t voting for Kamala Harris because he agrees with her on the issues. He’s voting for her because there’s a rhinoceros charging and she has the tranquilizer gun.
Seth Meyers,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off tonight in their first and only scheduled presidential debate. And if it went anything like the last one, that’s probably why you’re still awake."
Seth Meyers,"According to ABC News, candidates were not allowed to interact with their staff during commercial breaks in tonight’s presidential debate. Said Trump [flashes map of Russia], ‘Oh, it’s like 4 a.m. there anyway.'"
Seth Meyers,"In a new interview, film director Ron Howard, who directed the movie adaptation of Ohio Senator J.D. Vance’s memoir Hillbilly Elegy said he does not support former President Trump. ‘Also, could you describe me as ‘ Apollo 13 director’ instead?'"
Seth Meyers,"The Taliban recently released a new 114-page manifesto of laws, including a ban on women’s voices in public. ‘But there’s some bad stuff in there, too,’ said J.D. Vance."
Seth Meyers,"In a new interview, former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley defensed her support of former President Trump and said, ‘We can either vote based on style or we can vote on substance.’ All right, no one’s voting for him on style. He looks like he’s wearing two skydancers from a used car lot."
Seth Meyers,"New Jersey residents are complaining that they can smell a foul odor that is reminiscent of cat urine, which sanitation officials assured them was just Staten Island marking its territory."

Jon Stewart,What an incredible display of the awkward tension that happens when your son is dating a bi-racial girl and you meet her parents for the first time.
Jon Stewart,"insane asylums” to flood America with immigrants] “Ladies and gentlemen. I just want to say after surviving the PTSD of the last presidential debate, how unbelievably refreshing it is to go back to the same old… Nobody’s gonna answer any f**king questions! This is unbelievable! We’re back—America is back!"
Jon Stewart,"John Stewart from the I Was Watching This Live Times-Picayune. Uh, yeah, what you just said, that’s actually insanely false."
Jon Stewart,Student loan smoke bomb! Poof!
Jon Stewart,The eagle has landed! She has attacked what is Donald Trump’s most cherished family members—his rally crowds.
Jon Stewart,"[After Trump once more disclaimed responsibility for inciting his followers to attack the Capitol] “And this is it, ladies and gentlemen. I don’t know if this debate’s going to change anything, I really don’t. People are awfully set in the manner that they view these proceedings. What I think is a home run answer for one candidate, someone else views as a dodge or a lie or any of those other things. In some ways, it doesn’t matter what they say any more. But one thing will always be true and it is the quality of the former President I respect the least. Whenever he is cornered and forced to face even the smallest of consequences for his own mendacity ans scheming, he reverts to the greatest refuge of scoundrels. As Shaggy would say, ‘It wasn’t me! I did nothign wrong, I just showed up. They’re the ones who went crazy.’ This man, who constantly professes to be your champion, who says they’re gonna have to go through him to get to you will always, when the boat is going down, be the first one into the lifeboats. Because in that moment, he will always say the same thing. ‘I didn’t know anything about it, I was just told to show up for a cruise!’ Even though everybody knows he was the f**king captain.” jon stewart"
Jon Stewart,"[Long pause] What the f**k? ‘I’ve got these unbelievable rallies, people don’t leave—EATING DOGS!!!!'"

Stephen Colbert,"‘She’s a Marxist. It’s her, Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, the most terrible Marxist of all. It’s horrible how they raised the price on everything. Nobody can even afford Duck Soup .'"
Stephen Colbert,Harris got under his skin like she was stuffing it with butter and rosemary.
Stephen Colbert,He was so nonsensical that she looked at him the way a parent looks at a kid giving a presentation on why they should be allowed to get a pet tiger.
Stephen Colbert,"Honestly, you had me at ‘Donald Trump left us.'"
Stephen Colbert,"[On Trump’s claim that his Covid response proved his administration did things “nobody thought possible”] ‘That is actually true. Before Trump, no one thought it was possible to inject bleach.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,Follow-up question—can a moderator win a debate?
Stephen Colbert,"‘Oh, I have been a leader on fertilization. In fact, I have been called a giant pile of fertilizer.'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘I’ve got babies—like, four, five babies, with only one dud in the group. Even the best of us can end up with an Eric, it’s very sad.'"
Stephen Colbert,"turn the page” on Trump] “Actually, turning the page seems kind of mild. I’d say burn the book, but that’s more of his thing."
Stephen Colbert,very good people on both sides
Stephen Colbert,"I said that?”] “Okay, but you can’t believe a thing I say, I’m crazy, everybody knows that. I’m the Hannibal Lecter whale guy. Immigrants are taking our cats and giving them operations to turn them into dogs and then eating the dogs. Whale!'"
Stephen Colbert,"It’s not fantastic when your character witness is an Eastern European strongman. ‘Mussolini loves me, Stalin, Gargamel, the guy from Minions movies, Captain Hook. Captain Hook loves me, he’s gonna get that Peter Pan and that Tinkerbell, I tell you.'"
Stephen Colbert,"eat [his] lunch”] “Don’t do it, Vlad! I know he looks crispy and salty, but he’ll back up on you like a bad clam."
Stephen Colbert,I have the concept of a plan
Stephen Colbert,"Let’s call it: Time of crazy, 9:31 p.m."
Stephen Colbert,"I can imagine that his campaign is pretty upset. Because while migrants might not be eating dogs, with his debate performance tonight, trump did eat a Philly turd steak."
Stephen Colbert,"I saw on television, no, I saw on television—it’s crazy what they’re doing. On television, there’s this one town where they make the dogs do all the work. They are the police, the fire department, everything. Little puppies, they’ve got these little puppies folks, no I saw it. They call them the Paw Patrol and their boss is a little boy.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Harris tried to cast Trump as a relic of the past. While Trump thinks relic is a condiment he puts on his hot dogs.
Jimmy Fallon,"She was like, ‘Trust me, after the last four years, I know a relic when I see one.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Harris was on the right, Trump was on the left, and Biden was at home wondering, Where do I know these guys from?"
Jimmy Fallon,"Just like the previous debate, there was no audience. Yup, they were speaking to a totally silent, empty room, or as J.D. Vance calls that, a rally."
