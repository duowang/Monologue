Jordan Klepper,"[On Trump “complaining about the refs” by attacking ABC moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis] “Yeah man, they were correcting you because of the things you were saying. That’s barely fact-checking. The moderators were reacting like normal human beings react when you hear the craziest sh*t you’ve ever heard. If you were at a cocktail party and your friend said, ‘Trans immigrants are eating dogs in Ohio!,’ you would say, ‘What the f**k are you talking about, Stu? No, they aren’t.’ You wouldn’t be like, ‘Okay, let’s move on to foreign policy.'” jordan klepper"
Jordan Klepper,"You think she was cheating because she seemed familiar with the questions? It’s a presidential debate. They always ask the same questions. It’s like being suspicious that someone knows all the words to ‘Take Me Out to the Ball Game.’ ‘How will you fix the economy?’ ‘What’s your stance on abortion?’ ‘Do you promise not to overthrow the government?’ Standard, boilerplate debate questions."
Jordan Klepper,"polls” claiming he’d won the debate by Putin-sized, not-at-all ludicrous margins] “Wow! Those certainly were numbers! Is this what Trump did during his debate prep, memorize all the numbers between 70 and 98?"
Jordan Klepper,"Imagine if Donald Trump spent all that energy on doing things correctly instead of pretending he did things correctly. I mean, if he had worked harder preparing for the debate, maybe he wouldn’t have had to pretend he won the debate. If he had worked harder to win in 2020, maybe he wouldn’t have had to pretend the election was rigged. And if he had worked harder on January 6, maybe he would have overthrown the government and wouldn’t have to be debating in the first place. It’s called work ethic, Donald, come on!” jordan klepper"
Jordan Klepper,"It was not a good night for Trump. In terms of personal tragedies for him, I’d put it somewhere between losing the 2020 election and the day Fox News started letting female anchors wear pants."
Jordan Klepper,"Last night, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump took to the debate stage to make their cases to Taylor Alison Swift. And whoever else happened to be watching."

Jordan Klepper,"I’m sorry, this is not my main takeaway, but someone’s cat went missing so they called their senator? I mean, were they like, ‘Hmm, should I call the President of the United States or should I start with my senator? You’ve gotta update those emergency numbers on your fridge, Barry.'"

Stephen Colbert,"Now, many doubts have been raised about these stories, but it does have a credible source. A screenshot of a Facebook post warning that the author’s neighbor’s daughter’s friend had discovered that her neighbors, supposedly immigrants, were trying to eat her cat.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Some of these nuts who worship [Trump] are saying she was wearing these special bluetooth earrings that allowed her staff to feed her information during the debate.
