name,monologue
Stephen Colbert,That makes sense because the winner of the Super Bowl and the debate were both endorsed by Taylor Swift.
Stephen Colbert,"In a CNN poll taken immediately after the debate, 63 percent said Harris won, and 37 percent said Trump won. Which of course means that 37 percent of Americans don’t own TVs."
Stephen Colbert,"WOW…”] “All right, but ‘wow’ can mean a lot of different things. ‘Oh, you graduated at the top of your class? Wow! You spent the valedictorian speech shouting about people eating pets? Wow…'"
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, you know J.D. Vance is gonna try to keep Trump away from Springfield, Ohio now because he is clearly a little scaredy cat."
Stephen Colbert,"And the surest way to know someone doesn’t care is when they keep telling you how much they don’t care. ‘I mean, I don’t care that Julie married a dentist named Chet Marianichi who lives at 272 Willis Avenue, is into scuba diving, and has a labradoodle named Nugget. Shh, here he comes. [Mimes looking through binoculars] Ohhh, f**k you, Nugget.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Surprisingly cogent analysis from Kennedy there. Is it possible that he ate a second, smarter brain-worm?"
Stephen Colbert,substance”] “On substance? Anyone who thinks Trump won that debate on substance is clearly on a substance.
Stephen Colbert,hooked up with the wrong horse
Stephen Colbert,"‘No way, Jack. Uh uh. You take that Jack, I might not be the bet debater but I can still zing you at the old hat chat.'"
Stephen Colbert,How incompetent do you have to be to use the same caption twice? Do you know what this means? Donald Trump actually wrote this book.
Jimmy Fallon,It might be the first time in his life that Trump was praying for low ratings.
Jimmy Fallon,"Yup, Harris wanted a second debate with Trump while Trump wanted a second debate with Biden."
Jimmy Fallon,"Following his rough debate, Trump’s inner circle is now doing damage control. I’m sorry, you work for Donald Trump, when are you not doing damage control?"
Jimmy Fallon,Ben and Jerry’s just unveiled a new Kamala Harris-inspired ice cream flavor called Coconut Jubilee. I have a feeling Biden is madder about this than the election.
Jimmy Fallon,"The $1.1 billion Mega Millions jackpot won six months ago in New Jersey still hasn’t been claimed. It’s Jersey, so that leaves two possibilities. Either the ticket’s missing or the guy is."
Jimmy Fallon,"And not to be outdone, Trump’s campaign is now selling friendship ankle monitors."
Jimmy Kimmel,"three-to-one” disadvantage] “And he’s right, it was three against one. Trump got humiliated by Kamala, the moderators, and by himself primarily."
Jimmy Kimmel,Members of Trump’s inner circle think another debate would be a bad idea. They say his performance was so disappointing he doesn’t know whether to call it Eric of Don Jr. at this point.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I guess when you eat as many buckets of chicken as Donald Trump does, eventually you turn into one."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Here’s the difference between Democrats and the Frank Frazetta fantasy world occupied by those who worship Donald Trump. When Joe Biden slipped into a coma and started dreaming about sarsaparilla during the debate, we acknowledged it. He acknowledged it. He said, ‘I had a bad night,’ and they sent him to live on a farm upstate."
Jimmy Kimmel,Can you imagine the outrage if Kamala signed a fla—Sean Hannity would be in the hospital right now. He’d be in the hospital punching himself in the face.
Jimmy Kimmel,Do you know what a vomit you have to be to get called out by Marjorie Taylor Greene?
Jimmy Kimmel,does not represent Donald Trump
Jimmy Kimmel,"They’ve traded the dog whistle in for a tuba, folks."
Jimmy Kimmel,"When he put that Trump hat on his head, he gave everyone in QAnon a brain aneurysm at once."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The venture is called World Liberty Financial, which is a name just generic enough that your grandparents will think they’re paying their insurance bill."
Seth Meyers,"You’re so close to getting it. ‘When you look at the fact that they were correcting me on everything and not correcting her, it can mean only one of two things. Either they were biased against me, or I was just saying insane things that were wrong—Oh God, Oh God. Ohh, is that it? Oh no, oh God. Did I say more factually untrue things? Oh I owe a lot of people a lot of apologies.'"
Seth Meyers,You might want to move that decimal point five spaces to the right.
Seth Meyers,"Hannity’s like an inveterate gambler telling you he bet all his money on a really sick racehorse. ‘His name’s Ricky the Rocket and he’s a lock to win. Sure, he’s got horse flu but he’s really adjusting well to his new wooden leg. Plus he’s blind, so that heightens all his other senses, like running. What do you mean running isn’t a sense? Oooooh, I gotta get my money back! [Starting bell sounds] Awwww, he blew up!'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"And yeah, he knows what you’re thinking [puts up photo of Trump], but he’s not a billionaire."
Seth Meyers,controlled himself more than normal
Seth Meyers,"[After McCarthy, again, claimed that Trump’s debacle was like planning a wedding that doesn’t go as planned, but “nobody notices”] “No, we definitely noticed. It was more like a New Jersey Italian wedding where the groom is on his third glass of red wine and the best man makes a joke about their bachelor days and the groom jumps over the table and says, ‘You son of a bitch!,’ and the bride says, ‘Tony, don’t do it!,’ and the groom says, ‘Which Tony, me or him?,’ and the best man says, ‘You wanna go?,’ and they start wailing on each other, and the groom’s mother screams, ‘Oh my God, cut it out, you freakin’ stugots!,’ and then the best man cries and the groom cries, and they hug it out, and the groom says, ‘I love you, bro,’ and the best man says, ‘I love you, bro,’ and then they pass out and the bride says, ‘Tony, wake up you freakin’ goombah!,’ and he wakes up and he says, ‘Oooooohhhh, what happened?,’ and his mother says, ‘Don’t worry, Tony, it’s a wedding, nobody saw it.'” Seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Even the weirdos who support Donald Trump, like bear carcass collector and brain-worm Gymboree RFK Jr, even they had to admit that Harris had a much better night."
Seth Meyers,"Also, nobody eats humans. That doesn’t make you discerning. You eat roadkill. You’re weird. When RFK Jr. is hungry, he orders a small salad on Uber Eats and hopes the driver hits something on the way over."
Jordan Klepper,"‘Yeah, can you imagine people relating to a celebrity billionaire? Someone who’s been on Time magazine, or hosted SNL , or been in a Kanye West music video. I can’t imagine anybody being impressed with that. I’m J.D. Vance and I have no sense of irony.'"
Jordan Klepper,"[On Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro similarly pooh-poohing celebrity endorsements] “Okay, okay, a little harsh. But Judge Jeanine Pirro has standards. She’s not gonna be impressed by some celebrity taking a political stance. That’s not something that’s going to excite her, ever. [Clip of Pirro gloating over The Rock not endorsing Biden] Okaaay, you know, look. You really expect Judge Jeanine to remember what she said four months ago? I’m pretty sure she’s had a Pacific Ocean amount of white wine since then.” jordan klepper"
Jordan Klepper,"Donald Trump has been flying around the country with far-right internet troll Laura Loomer, a 9/11 conspiracy theorist who Trump brought to a 9/11 ceremony yesterday. A 9/11 truther at a 9/11 ceremony. Is that like an atheist going to Easter mass? ‘Well, I don’t believe in any of this, but as long as you guys are having fun.'"
Jordan Klepper,"If you want an idea of just how extreme Loomer is, Marjorie Taylor Greene is calling her out for being racist. And not even in a ‘stop stealing my bit’ kind of way."
Jordan Klepper,I didn’t even know there was a level of racist above Marjorie Taylor Greene. It’s like finding out a movie can be rated NC-39.
Jordan Klepper,"You know what, it’s honestly exhausting trying to keep up with the right-wing media’s spinning and its lies. And if you were paying attention yesterday, you probably saw this picture of Joe Biden, where he’s wearing a Trump 2024 hat. And a bunch of Trump fans called him senile and demented, which was mean, and also a weird thing to say to a guy for wearing your candidate’s hat."
Jordan Klepper,"Joe Biden was at an event honoring the first responders on September 11th. And several people at the event were wearing Trump shirts. Which frankly is a cool thing about America. I mean, nobody in Russia is meeting Vladimir Putin wearing a Navalny shirt, you know? If they do, they’re not leaving through the door."
Jordan Klepper,"I tell you what, if you ask me, this is what you want form the President of the United States when he meets a voter on the other side. He doesn’t get mad at him, he doesn’t try to hard sell him. He just shows warmth and a bit of empathy. And they did a remarkable thing that you don’t see among two people on opposite sides these days—they had a laugh. And with a simple exchange of hats, they were able to share something much more meaningful. Lice.” jordan klepper"
