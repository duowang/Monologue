Jimmy Kimmel,I was up against three other shows. It was three-on-one !
Jimmy Kimmel,"We’ve got Donald and now his son Daffy Duck, too."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He appears to be a troubled individual. His political views are all over the place. He tweeted earlier this year that his dream ticket would be Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, which is how you know he’s nuts."
Jimmy Kimmel,"[On Trump decrying others’ inflammatory rhetoric] “Right, you are nothing if not a calming influence. This is a man who for the last week has been spreading a complete lie that he knows is a lie saying that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. This is a man who just last week joked about Nancy Pelosi’s 84-year-old husband being brutally attacked with a hammer by one of his deranged fans. This is a man who literally hours before this happened, posted on Truth Social, the words, I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Oh, I see. Do you get it yet—the only way to expose the truth is to spread a lie. It’s the power of storytelling."
Jimmy Kimmel,"How is it possible, Trump picked even a worse candidate than him?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"The one topic he actually knows something about, million dollar toilets , and they cut away."
Jimmy Fallon,"Tonight at Mar-a-Lago, former President Trump announced the launch of Eric and Don Jr’s crypto business. Even people who went to Trump University are like, ‘Sounds like a scam.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Eric said the startup will promote financial independence. Which is fun coming from someone who ‘s who’s 40 and still not financially independent.
Jimmy Fallon,"During a new interview, J.D. Vance admitted that he created the false claim about immigrants eating pets to create media attention. Trump was like, ‘Everyone knows the first rule of fake news is not admitting to fake news.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Yup, Vance admitted that he made the whole thing up, but besides being overtly racist and making Trump look like a total fool at the debate, no harm done, right?"
Jimmy Fallon,"23 and Me is paying 30 million dollars to settle a data breach lawsuit. Today, every customer got a message like, ‘You’ve been hacked by Russia, China, North Korea, and a little bit Cherokee.'"
Jimmy Fallon,You can tell it’s almost fall because the seafood at the Times Square Bubba Gump is starting to turn from green to brown.
Jimmy Fallon,"According to a new report, West Virginia is the top state in the country for marriage longevity. ‘Cause most couple in West Virginia share a lot in common, including DNA."
Taylor Tomlinson,"[Following a Surgeon General’s report that the stress of parenting is harmful to health] “Crazy that the government said parenting is stressful. Like, whoa, new information alert! Next thing you know, they’re like, ‘Breaking news: getting stabbed may cause bleeding.’ Taylor Tomlinson"
Taylor Tomlinson,"They called parental stress an urgent public health issue, putting it in the same category as cigarettes. Yeah, that’s why you always hear people saying, ‘I mostly quit, but after a few drinks, I’ll sing one Baby Shark.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,Maybe it makes sense to treat having kids like smoking.I know at restaurants I’d ask to be seated in the non-baby section.
