name,monologue
Ronny Chieng,"So why did this guy come for Trump? I mean, according to J.D. Vance, Trump’s V.P. and the worst thing to happen to cat ladies since feline AIDS, Democrats made him do it."
Ronny Chieng,"Yeah, liberals, stop accurately describing Trump. You’re putting him in danger when you repeat the things he says verbatim!"
Ronny Chieng,"But J.D. Vance has a point. The left needs to stop stop calling its political opponents fascists, okay? You don’t see Donald Trump doing that all the time."
Ronny Chieng,"a Marxist, communist, fascist… person “] “That last one, it felt like he ran out of words that end in ‘-ist?’ ‘She’s a Marxist, communist, fascist… dermatologist.'"
Ronny Chieng,"I mean, Trump has called Kamala Harris fascist so much, I’m not sure he knows her name. It’s like when you say to a coworker, ‘Oh hey, um, it’s good to see you, my fascist buddy.'"
Ronny Chieng,"Whether or not you think the rhetoric should be toned down, it’s just not something that Trump and Vance actually believe in. I mean for the past week, the city of Springfield has been overrun with bomb threats after Trump and Vance claimed that Haitian immigrants are eating everyone’s cats and dogs, which there is no evidence of. I mean, people love posting photos of their food, okay, so we would have seen it by now.” Ronny chieng"
Ronny Chieng,"Yeah, the guy who wants everyone to believe he’s super concerned about political violence can’t even bring himself to say he’s against bomb threats. I mean, what more information are you waiting for. It’s a bomb threat. Do you need to know who the bomb was gonna vote for?"
Ronny Chieng,"I mean, I can’t believe this guy is saying there are very fine bomb threats on both sides."
Ronny Chieng,"This isn’t a trick question, this is a layup for politicians. It’s like, ‘Do you support the troops?,’ or ‘Do you like Taylor Swift?’ Just say yes."
Ronny Chieng,"Hey, would you people stop trying to assassinate Donald Trump? Not only is it morally wrong, but you’re also just giving him more things to brag about. ‘They only tried to kill Abraham Lincoln once! That makes me twice as great as him!'"
Ronny Chieng,"This week a crazy person tried to hunt Donald Trump in his natural habitat, his golf course."
Ronny Chieng,"This guy managed to walk into Trump’s golf course and stay there undetected for 12 hours. Okay, and I don’t know if you’ve thought about this Trump, but maybe you should consider building, you know, like a wall?"
Ronny Chieng,"By the way, have you noticed that the news reports are all like, ‘A harrowing near tragedy, sending chill through the nation.’ And meanwhile everyone you actually know is like, ‘Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, I saw that.'"
Ronny Chieng,"Ooof, Donald Trump tweeting, ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!’ That’s dangerous. I mean, I would rather buy one of those Hezbollah pagers than tweet ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!’ I think Trump needs to stick to racism, it’s less divisive."
Ronny Chieng,"The assassin this weekend was probably not a Swifite, okay. He doesn’t fit the M.O. Swifties are non-violent. They prefer to cyber-bully you until you kill yourself."
Ronny Chieng,"Welcome to the Emmy Award-winning Daily Show . I’m Emmy Award winner Ronny Chieng, please address me as such. “ Ronny chieng"
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump’s running mate is right. We should all tone down the rhetoric and follow the example of Donald Trump. You can say many things about Donald Trump, but one thing you can’t say about Donald Trump is that this man—whose name, just to remind you, is Donald Trump—has never been anything other than a sober, cautious statesman who has steadied the national mood with his tempered rhetoric and calm, even-handed demeanor. I don’t know why you’re laughing. Because we’re talking about Donald Trump, this man, Donald Trump, who has been no less than a beacon of moderation amongst a sea of division and angst.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"You guys have to tell me what clips are gonna be before I come out here! Because right now, I look the fool."
Seth Meyers,"Anyway, the point is maybe we give Trump a second mulligan. Sure, he called Democrats fascists, and sure, he called them a threat to Democracy, and sure, he incited a violent mob to ransack the Capitol, and said Mike Pence should be hanged, and promised to pardon January 6 rioters, and mocked the brutal assault on Paul Pelosi, and downplayed a kidnapping plot against the governor of Michigan, and refused to tone down his rhetoric after one of his supporters sent pipe bombs to Trump critics—wait, where was this going?” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"So Trump has been saying for years that Democrats are fascist threats and vermin—which, by the way, is way worse. Using ‘vermin’ to describe your political opponents is insane. ‘Democrats need to tone down the rhetoric!’ ‘Will Trump stop saying vermin ?’ ‘He caaaan’t. He just loves saying it.'"
Seth Meyers,"So they keep using this language, saying Democrats will destroy the country and, side note, Democrats have already won multiple times and none of that sh*t came true. Joe Biden didn’t turn the country into a fascist dictatorship. You know how I know? I’ve played that clip of him falling up the stairs about a thousand times and not only am I still a free man, he came on this show."
Seth Meyers,would be a dictator on day one
Seth Meyers,"So now it’s okay to just create stories, J.D. Vance, you serial couch-f**ker?"
Stephen Colbert,"Nothing like blaming someone else for something you’re doing in the same sentence. ‘Darling, you calling me unattractive hurts my feelings. Marriage should be built on love, and I’m beginning to think you’re too fugly to understand that.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Trump’s getting no help toning down the rhetoric from his flunkies, including Elon Musk, who tweeted, ‘No one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala [thinky face emoji.]’ Really? Is thinky-face the right emoji for openly suggesting political violence? I’d have gone with telephone-officer-down arrow-down arrow-poop emoji. ‘Cause you’re about to get a call from the Secret Service, and are in deep, deep sh*t.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, it’s true. In these divisive times, you have to create a lie just to get attention. J.D. Vance knows this personally because he’s also the victim of a hateful rumor that he had sex with a couch. And I want to repeat, he did not have sex with a couch. Because I am now hearing that, on that night, he could not perform. Yes, despite a perfectly romantic evening and an amorous, enthusiastic love seat, when the time came, J.D. Vance was E.D. Vance. His penis was softer than a throw-pillow. That night, truly, he was the La-Z-Boy.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,What? An unsubstantiated claim on Facebook? What else are they lying about on there? Is it possible that Braden’s space-themed 10th birthday party wasn’t out of this world?
Stephen Colbert,"Haitia”] “That’s right, Haitians come from Haitia much in the way that lesbians come from Lesbia and Donald Trump comes from Dementia."
Stephen Colbert,"And I just want to state the obvious right off the bat. Political violence has no place in America. In fact, can I talk to all the gun owners for a second, right over here. [Addresses camera] Don’t shoot anyone. If you have even the vaguest idea that you might shoot someone, sell your gun and use that money to buy yourself a little treat. Like pancakes. IHOP. You know, maybe some pancakes, maybe get a little extra whipped cream on there. Or one of those bicycle license plates with your name on it. Or, you know what, a flute, learn to flute, learn the flute, okay? Then call your kids and tell them you traded in your guns for a flute—they might visit.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, how could he have possibly guessed that Trump would be golfing. That’s as unforeseeable as Pitbull up in the club with some big-booty mamis."
Stephen Colbert,"First clue he’s insane, he left Hawaii for Florida."
Stephen Colbert,awfully familiar with the questions
Jimmy Fallon,"Former President Trump said that due to issues with the U.S. Postal Service, he’s considering a lawsuit to challenge mail-in ballots. I can’t wait until after the election when Trump accuses immigrants of eating the ballots."
Jimmy Fallon,"You can tell that it’s almost fall because over at LaGuardia, all the pilots have switched from hard seltzer to hard cider."
Jimmy Fallon,"The FDA just approved a sleep apnea detection feature on the new Apple Watch. As opposed to the old sleep apnea detection feature, your wife rolling over and slapping you."
Jimmy Fallon,"Police in Ohio said that an eight-year-old girl drover herself to Target and went shopping. And here’s the most shocking part, she left without spending over 300 dollars."
Jimmy Kimmel,"They say they’re legit. They’re working with top security experts in the world, including Zokyo, Fuzzland, PeckShield, and other top companies with names that sound like sex toy manufacturers."
Jimmy Kimmel,"alpha males”] “The guy behind this is a gentleman named Chase Herro, who calls himself ‘the dirtbag of the internet.’ And I don’t know if you’ve seen the internet, but there’s some stiff competition for that title."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Trumps will get paid for promoting this crypto but, according to Bloomberg, the platform isn’t owned, managed, operated, or sold by any of them. Which is something I look forward to hearing them say in four years when this gets all of them arrested."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Maybe the weirdest part of the whole thing is that Trump’s youngest son Barron is part of this. He’s their ‘DeFi Visionary.’ That’s right, their visionary graduated high school three months ago. Which I have to admit is impressive. My dad would never have trusted me to run one of his criminal enterprises when I was that age."
Taylor Tomlinson,"These rules feel like they’re trying to de-sexualize flight attendants, but, like sorry Delta, but flight attendants are inherently sexy to me. A woman in uniform who straps me into a little chair for 90 minutes? Who tells me I can’t go pee when I want to? And I’m supposed to not be horny for sky mommy?"
Taylor Tomlinson,"[After a clip of a male podcaster freaking out over a new dating philosophy for women called 6-6-6]”Every time a woman has standards for herself, a male podcaster gets his wings.” Taylor Tomlinson"
Taylor Tomlinson,"For any guys panicking right now, I don’t think we’re in any danger of tilting the playing field any time soon. I feel like every straight couple I see in L.A. is made up of a woman who just got cast in a Victoria’s Secret commercial and a man who just got diamond rank in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare ."
Taylor Tomlinson,"The standards for women have always been high. There’s even an unspoken 6-6-6 for us. We get six minutes a day to ourselves, we get to eat six calories, and then we get called a six."
