Seth Meyers,"weaving”] “In fairness to Trump, recent polls have found that the top three policy concerns among voters are, ‘How many times do you flush a toilet?,’ ‘What do Tic Tacs look like?,’ and ‘Was Pavarotti a nice guy?'"
Seth Meyers,"response”—to a question about American manufacturing jobs] “What. Are you Talking. About. The number one threat to manufacturing jobs is nuclear weapons? Okay, in that case the number one threat to the New York Giants is nuclear weapons. ‘Oh sure, it’s easy to blame roster construction and play calling, but they drop a nuke on MetLife, the season is over!'"
Seth Meyers,"[Same, this time about grocery prices] “Seriously, what are you talking about? We’d get a more coherent answer if we took a bunch of Scrabble letters, dumped them into a Bingo cage, picked ‘em out at random, translated from English to French and the back to German and then back to English, then recorded them on a VHS and played the tape backward. I’m honestly in awe of the fact that he can talk that long without making any sense whatsoever. I can’t even pretend to be him for that long. Here, I’ll try it: ‘Look, it’s very simple. Grocery prices are going up, due in large part to the massive disruptions caused by Covid and the predatory practices of large corporations’—Oh, sorry, that’s the real answer. Let me try again. ‘Grocery prices because of energy causing windmills to attack toilets flushing sharks down into the water next to the boats that have whales eating Tic Tacs causing’… Ahhhhhhh, f**k, I can’t do it!” seth meyers"

Seth Meyers,"in the ear”] “For what it’s worth, if Harris did have people in her ear saying, ‘No Kamala, do this, say it this way, Kamala, okay be quiet, too many people watching,’ and still managed to kick your ass, I wouldn’t be telling us about it. If anything, watching that debate, I believe that you were wearing an earpiece that was just playing this on a loop. [Plays “Who Let the Dogs Out"
Seth Meyers,"In Trump’s mind, the only way that anyone could coherently answer questions about policy on the fly is if they’re getting fed the answers in real time. That says more about you than it does about her. ‘The clarity of her answers was very suspicious to me, because let me tell you, if they asked me those questions, I would have no f**king idea what to say. I wouldn’t even know where to start. I mean, you saw me at the debate, right? [Puts up picture of Trump] I mean, look at my eyes. I am just gone. There is nothing th—I look like a goldfish when you don’t clean the bowl for a week.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"articulate a clear, coherent policy position"
Seth Meyers,"Now, we all know the caveats here. These are just isolated polls, the polls are just snapshots and they could easily change. But try telling that to Donald Trump, a man with so much rage and so little impulse control, he scream-tweeted ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!’ in all caps like his sister was blasting Midnights through his bedroom wall."
Seth Meyers,"Oh my God, Trump’s behind in Pennsylvania. Can you imagine what he’s going to blurt out at his next rally? ‘Gritty is a communist! Everybody knows it, look at his eyes. He’s a meth addict and a communist, many people are telling me, it’s so true.'"

Ronny Chieng,"Oh my God, that’s huge! I assume. From the way he said it. I mean, I guess this is a big deal.

Well, a half-point decrease means that now you can afford a bus ticket to drive past it."
Ronny Chieng,"This is great news. Donald Trump, the world’s most trustworthy businessman, is now in crypto, the world’s most trustworthy business."
Ronny Chieng,"Holy sh*it, they got four Trumps now! I mean, forget nepo babies, that’s a whole nepo nursery."
Ronny Chieng,"Wow, Trump’s partner is this is a weed dealer turned prisoner, turned colon cleanse marketer? I mean, clearly he understands the concept of diversifying your portfolio."
Ronny Chieng,"So the guy running Trumps’ crypto company says crypto is basically, and I quote, ‘a can of sh*t, wrapped in piss’ that you can sell to idiots. I mean, that is crazy—I did not know you could wrap something in piss. That’s a liquid."
