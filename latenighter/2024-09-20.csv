Seth Meyers,"As we all know, every presidential election comes down to Long Island. We all remember the nail-biting final days of the 2020 election when everyone waited with bated breath to see which candidate would win the crucial demographic of uncles who smoke Marlboro Lights and won’t stop talking about the Jets’ 98 season. ‘Let me tell you somethin’ kid, I’ll vote for anybody who gives the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Vinny Testaverde…'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Harry, get your fat ass out of the couch!"
Seth Meyers,"I’m willing to bet anything Trump has not been inside a subway car since, at most, the 1950’s. The last time he was on a subway train, they probably had nice leather seats and those classic subway ads that said stuff like, ‘Got a tyke, give ‘em a Lucky Strike!'"
Seth Meyers,"[After a fear-mongering Trump claimed that there was a “75 percent chance” parents would never see their subway-riding kids again, followed by a reminiscence of his own parents letting him ride alone as a child] “That might be a case of them not being afraid you were gonna disappear, but being afraid you were gonna come back. ‘My parents, they would put me on the subway, they wouldn’t even tell me where I was going. I’d say, ‘Mother, father, how am I gonna get home?’ And they’d just laugh because the subway was so safe. And as the doors would close and the train was rolling away, I’d see them high five each other, the happiest I had ever seen them because of how safe the subway was. And then I’d ride the rails for days and days until I’d find my way home, and they’d be so excited, they’d say, ‘Dear God! What are you doing here?’ And I’d say, ‘Mother and father, I knew you were worried, and good news, the subway is safe.’ And they’d break down crying tears of joy. Because of how safe the subway was.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Well, if that isn’t the most Miss Sassy move I have ever heard. ‘I’m gonna go hide in the basement to start some rumors. You know why, cause I’m Sassy.'"
Seth Meyers,"Man, has any public figure ever been as offputting as J.D. Vance? I didn’t think anyone could ever out-Ted Cruz Ted Cruz, but this son of a bitch did it."
Seth Meyers,"[On Trump’s announced plan to pour gasoline on the fire he started] “Why are you going to Springfield? Why? To make things worse for everyone there whose lives you’ve already disrupted? Even the Republican Mayor of Springfield said he’d prefer that Trump stay away. Look, I have an idea. Since Trump is so into the subway now, how about we just put him on the F Train and tell him it goes to Springfield? He’ll end up holding a press conference on Coney Island. ‘Not only are they eating dogs, they have contests where they try to eat as many as they can.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"[On J.D. Vance, caught in his pet buffet lie, refocused on lying that Springfield’s Haitian immigrants are there illegally ] “Oh, you’re still gonna call them illegal aliens? Well, I’m still gonna call you a couch-f**ker. Actually, I’m gonna add some more details to it. J.D. Vance didn’t just have relations with a couch, he got caught in a threesome with a La-Z-Boy and an Eames chair. Is that rumor true? I don’t know if that rumor is true, I would say that the media should fact-check it, but they’re too busy chasing down all his other lies. And by the way, guys… I don’t think it’s just couches. Remember how nervous and weird J.D. was when he was ordering donuts? What was he gonna do with those donuts? I’ll let you decide. ‘I would like som, uh, donuts.’ ‘What flavor?’ ‘Doesn’t matter. Just make sure they have holes.'” seth meyers"
Stephen Colbert,what the hell do you have to lose?
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, people love you in New York, sir. In fact, just this summer Trump won a unanimous vote from 12 of his peers."
Stephen Colbert,‘But it doesn’t always happen. I tried to put Eric on there but he just kept coming home.'
Stephen Colbert,"Nude Africa”—said he’d choose Hitler over former President Obama] “Okay that is horrible, but also off topic for a porn message board. ‘Mark, come on, stay focused. we’re not talking about Hitler right now! We’re debating whether that delivery man was fairly compensated for the pizza he delivered with extra sausage, if you know what I mean.'"
Stephen Colbert,"But here’s the thing, Robinson is a fundamentalist Christian nationalist who’s got a lot of ideas about what you should or should not be able to do in the bedroom. Especially you ladies, with your dangerous sexy areas."
Stephen Colbert,I don’t want to kink-shame. We’re sex positive here at The Late Show . You do you—which I’m pretty sure is what he was doing in there five nights a week.
Stephen Colbert,"Black Nazi” brag] “Meaning Donald Trump might say he’s a very fine person, but would not rent an apartment to him ."
Stephen Colbert,"Well, you’re halfway there Mark. Women can still vote, but I’m guessing not for you."
Stephen Colbert,"peeping” on women without their knowledge] “ That is gonna be a tough one for the GOP to defend. ‘Um, when he said he was peeping on women, he just meant tossing bright yellow marshmallow chicks on the ladies. Um, Happy… Easter…'"
Stephen Colbert,"Since kicking Trump’s caboose in the debate, Harris been surging in the polls. But remember, your vote doesn’t matter unless you’re in a state [pushes glasees seductively down nose] that swings."
Stephen Colbert,"Mickey and his crew”] “Yes, public enemy number one, Mickey Rat. And his crew, Donald Goose, Jiminy Cockroach, and Winnie the Donkey."
Ronny Chieng,"Now I know what you’re thinking, is New York a swing state? No, it’s not. But Trump just wanted to go someplace where people wear more bronzer than him."
Ronny Chieng,"Are you good to drive, bro? I mean, Rudy is so feral I’m worried RFK Jr. will put him in his trunk."
Ronny Chieng,And good luck trying to outrun Rudy Giuliani on three whiskeys.
Ronny Chieng,"The cat was in the basement the whole time! Here’s a little tip for anyone out there with a missing pet, okay? Before you accuse your Haitian neighbors of stealing them, maybe you could first try looking around your house ."
Ronny Chieng,"screwed up royally”] “‘Uh, whoopsie-doopsie! Sorry, I set off a race war in the middle of a presidential election, that’s totally my bad.'"
Ronny Chieng,"So what you’re saying is that it’s okay to say things that are bullsh*t to get people to focus on other things that aren’t bullsh*t? I mean if that’s true this is gonna revolutionize the way I write resumes. ‘Okay, okay, I wasn’t the CEO of Microsoft, buuut, how else would you have noticed that I was proficient in Excel?'"
Ronny Chieng,"In a way, Vance’s plan did work, because it did bring attention to another, bigger issue. That these guys are all super-racist. So, very sneaky J.D."
Ronny Chieng,"I mean, looks like this guy is pretty anti-‘the gays.’ And if there’s one thing history has taught us, it’s that when a politician is so outspoken about how gross gay and trans people are, there will be nothing in his internet history that will embarrass him at all. In 3… 2… 1…"
Ronny Chieng,This is the craziest combination of scandals I’ve ever seen. But the most insane part of this is that he said all of this in the comments section of a porn site. Nobody should be writing in the comments section of a porn site! You know what you should be commenting on a porn site? Nothing! You’re not there to make friends!
Ronny Chieng,I guess there are more than two genders when it’s time to jerk it.
Ronny Chieng,"Wow, this is the worst Nutty Professor reboot ever."
Ronny Chieng,"Look, this is not going to play well with his base. His political base—not his other, uh…"
Ronny Chieng,"So this guy called himself a Nazi who likes Hitler and slavery. I take it back, I think maybe his base will still like him."
Ronny Chieng,"You’re spending way too much time on porn sites if you’re getting into your views on slavery, okay?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s right, the guy who can’t differentiate the Four Seasons from a dildo store is gonna find ya. You’ve been warned."
Jimmy Kimmel,In other words none of these polls mean anything at all. They are meaningless and yet we keep looking at them. They’re like the Kardashians in a lot of ways.
Jimmy Kimmel,Sounds like things are solid at home.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Not so busy he can’t play golf on Sunday, but very very busy."
Jimmy Kimmel,"And even though he hasn’t read it, he knows it’s great. Unless it isn’t, in which case he will destroy her."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He lies about everything all the time, he couldn’t tell one more lie about his wife’s book? ‘Read it, loved it.’ Was that so difficult?"
Jimmy Kimmel,We’re now 46 days away from Donald Trump claiming he won the election.
Jimmy Kimmel,"9 or 11 times” (It was four times)] “And by the way, those weren’t even fact checks, those were mental health welfare checks."
Jimmy Kimmel,"went wild” for him] “At least in the past when he exaggerated the size of a crowd, there was a crowd."
Taylor Tomlinson,"I mean, knightcore is a little strange, sure, but if it gets dudes to stop wearing cargo shorts, then prithee play on, good sir."
Taylor Tomlinson,"I’d wear a full suit of armor to go literally anywhere. Like my therapists office: ‘You can’t make me cry, I’m wearing a sword.’ taylor tomlinson"
Jimmy Fallon,"Thats’ right, today I turned 50, which is incredible because at the beginning of this election season, I was only 39."
Jimmy Fallon,"Russia is now urging its citizens to make babies during work breaks to help with the country’s birth rate. Yeah, and you thought it was rough when your coworker ate lunch at their desk."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yup, Trump spent $950 on burgers and Diet Cokes and then was like, ‘Does anyone else want something?'"
