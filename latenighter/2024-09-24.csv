Jimmy Kimmel,"CNN said he wrote some very creepy stuff on the Nude Africa message board, included referring to himself as a ‘Black Nazi,’ which is shocking—I mean, who knew porn sites had message boards."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Right, forget the truth, let’s find out what the people think and then we’ll decide what we think. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a dog-eater to catch."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Jewish voters don’t need Donald Trump to guilt them for the decisions they make, that’s what Jewish mothers are for."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Trump coin, it should be noted, costs $100. It contains $31 worth of silver. And what captures the essence of Donald Trump more than charging the fans who love him the most three times what a coin is worth."
Jimmy Kimmel,$100 for a Chuck E. Cheese token with his head on it.
Jimmy Kimmel,"‘And if you don’t believe it, ask my wife Melania who every night prays I drive my golf cart into a lagoon.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s not true but he says it with such conviction, you know? He’s a convicted vapist."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The story says Kennedy was bragging to his friends that Nuzzi sent shots of herself nude, which are the only shots he will get, by the way."
Seth Meyers,"I will say, one nice thing about this story is that it gives everyone a chance to pretend they have no idea how porn sites work. You know, like how I just did. ‘Honey, did you see this story about Mark Robinson? It is crazy, honey. I guess there are these sites on the world wide web, the internet. And they are a collection of, oh my gosh, what would you even call it? Erotica? Stag films? Anyway, I’m so disgusted after Googling the details of this story that I’m, gonna clear my internet history. So in case you’re wondering, that’s why I’m clearing the history on all my devices.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"‘Martin Luther King times two?’ I don’t know, man. Seems like a Bizarro Martin Luther King where everything is opposite. I mean, I can see him giving an ‘I Have a Nightmare’ speech: ‘I have a nightmare where an intrepid reporter digs into the comments section of Nude Africa and figures out my identity due to my sloppiness in sharing distinguishing information.'"
Seth Meyers,"‘I don’t believe him. I don’t not believe him. I don’t not disbelieve him. I don’t not not un-disbelieve him. But most importantly, and this is what you, the mainstream media refuses to report on, I don’t not not not not dis-un-de-believe him.'"
Seth Meyers,"What a charismatic, silver tongued salesman. I can’t believe America hasn’t fallen head over heels for this guy yet. Those comments for Robinson aren’t A.I., but J.D. Vance, I would definitely believe he’s A.I.—J.D. Vance is what you get if you ask A.I. to generate Ted Cruz for a low-budget porno."
Seth Meyers,"First of all, that’s not what people use A.I. for. They don’t use A.I. to fake decades-old comments by politicians on porn sites. They use A.I. to see what Homer Simpson would look like if he was a real guy. [Shows horrifying A.I. picture of real world Homer] By the way, that guy definitely uses his real name to leave comments on porn sites."
Seth Meyers,"The dude called himself a Nazi on a porn website. How hard is that to denounce? If you can’t denounce that, you can’t denounce anything. Which of course is one of the job requirements when you’re Donald Trump’s running mate, right? You have to fully remove your soul and the capacity for shame and self-reflection so you can just stand there blankly and say something as patently absurd as ‘I don’t not believe him’ without bursting into tears and screaming, ‘What am I doing with my life?!'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Do you know how much can happen in six weeks these days? That’s enough time for you to take the lead in the polls, lose the lead, get indicted like three more times, take the lead again, drop out, leave a comment on Nude Africa using your alias Donald K. Trump, lose the lead, get back in, drop J.D. Vance, confuse J.D. Vance with Mike Pence, combine them into a politician named Mike D. Pants…"
Seth Meyers,"I’ve never seen him answer a question so succinctly before. That might be the first time he’s ever kept an answer to under three minutes. He didn’t mention toilets or windmills once. Donald, I can’t believe I’m asking this but, you okay, bud?"
Stephen Colbert,"Robinson made troubling online comments where he described himself as a Black Nazi, spoke favorably of reinstating slavery, and said Mein Kampf is ‘a good read’ on a porn message forum called Nude Africa. Which is the most popular continent focused porn site next to Topless Antarctica and Just Butts Australia."
Stephen Colbert,Despite denying that they are his posts… Robinson has declined offers to enlist tech experts to help exonerate him. You gotta go to the experts and have them do forensics on your hard drive. I believe for Robinson they have to take his laptop to the Apple Penius Bar.
Stephen Colbert,"Since the story came out, four top staff members on Robinson’s campaign team have resigned. And to ensure that Mark Robinson would read their resignation letters, they posted them to Nude Africa."
Stephen Colbert,"He named his dog after his truck. That is peak middle America dad. ‘Hey there, these are my kids Dodge Ram, and right over there is the apple of our eye, J.D. Power and Associates Best Class Mid Sized Sedan. Named her for her grandma.'"
Stephen Colbert,"If somebody breaks in my house, they’re getting shot"
Stephen Colbert,was not the real Oprah
Stephen Colbert,"illegal aliens,” telling the crowd, “think of it"
Stephen Colbert,"happy, healthy, confident, and free,"
Stephen Colbert,"So from now on when someone asks, ‘Do you know where I can get a hand-job,’ you say, ‘From the Republicans in Georgia.'"
Jon Stewart,"Exploding pagers, ah. Lebanon expected Israel to attack from the south, but instead they attacked from the 1980’s."
Jon Stewart,There was a time back in the olden days when we didn’t have cellphones but we still wanted to buy drugs.
Jon Stewart,"Okay so its not a war, it’s a volatile situationship. A friends with bombenfits, if you will ."
Jon Stewart,"Or as that is sometimes called, war !"
Jon Stewart,What anti-Semites the… former Prime Minister of Israel and former defense minster are!
Jon Stewart,"But still, people are gonna see this segment and go, ‘All right, maybe Israel isn’t perfect, but criticizing them feeds the fire. Don’t you worry about anti-Semitism?’ And to that I say no. I believe anti-Semitism will be fine. I gotta say, not for nothing, but from what I’ve experienced, it’s very resilient. And it’s not really tied to any event, or war, or activity, or reality. For God’s sake, Kanye thought we ruined his Adidas deal. We didn’t, we just need orthotics, that’s all.” jon stewart"
Jon Stewart,"Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe the ‘blame the Jews’ from the Black Death from the Spanish Inquisition to the space lasers will all go away if Israel does right. And peace will reign, and people will no longer baselessly and conveniently blame the Jews when things don’t work out exactly the way they want them to. [Clip of Trump blaming the Jews if he loses] Son of a bitch!"
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, 140 world leaders just got here and Trump is already claiming that they’re eating our pets."
Jimmy Fallon,It’s that special time of year when you get to see the King of Norway buy a fake Rolex from the Times Square Elmo.
Jimmy Fallon,"You’ve really got to give it up to Bruce, not many bosses in New Jersey make it to 75."
