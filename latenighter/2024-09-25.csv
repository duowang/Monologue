Desi Lydic,stressed and depressed and unhappy
Desi Lydic,"I love how he’s acknowledging that we’re stressed out as if he’s not the one stressing us out. This is like Boeing saying, ‘Weird how people keep being so stressed out about air travel these days.'"
Desi Lydic,"But Trump is a master marketer. That’s how you sell things to women—you convince them they have a problem and then you say, ‘Here, buy these vagina gummies.’ And yes, in this analogy Trump is the vagina gummy."
Desi Lydic,Although it’s not true that all women are poorer—E. Jean Carroll seems to be doing pretty well.
Desi Lydic,"I know what you’re thinking, how can Trump expect women to support him when he took away abortion rights. Well luckily he has an answer for that. [Clip of Trump promising, “You will no longer be thinking about abortion"
Desi Lydic,"Yeah, how dare a woman who can’t get pregnant care about abortion. Only men who can’t get pregnant can care about abortion."
Desi Lydic,"People should only care about issues that affect their bodies. Why do you care about it, Bernie Moreno? It’s abortion, not the rising price of extra-small condoms. “ desi lydic"
Desi Lydic,"Smurf.” So here we go. ‘Right when I was really pumping the Smurf chute good, she shot a long, hard stream of Smurf up in the air that covered my chest in Smurf. It was so Smurfing hot. She was Smurfin’, I was Smurfin’, she was Smurfin’, I was covered in Smurf, and Smurf juice and Smurf. Damn.’ [Shudders.] There goes my childhood."
Desi Lydic,"[On Robinson’s defiant press conference about all the porn and Nazi stuff] “‘Yeah, people listen up. There are real issues at stake here. Inflation is so high, America’s MILFs can’t afford to pay their pool boys! Utilities are so expensive, young men are forced to shower with their stepmoms! Cities are so strapped that MTA is raising prices on the Bang Bus! American families are so poor that they’re living ass-to-mouth. And immigrants are stealing all our jobs, hand and blow.'” desi lydic"
Stephen Colbert,"That’s just upsetting. That sounds like he eats babies, or is he building a baby army? Wait a second, is he Rumpelstiltskin? ‘You’ll never get your baby back unless you can guess my name. Wait, how’d you guess it? Oh, it’s in gold, two-story letters on everything I own? Damn you, me!'"

Stephen Colbert,"Well why would anyone be ashamed of that? ‘Okay honey, yes, I do have subscriptions to multiple porn sites. But one of them I will have you know, is Wife Lovers. Are you a member of Husband Lovers? Aha, no! And I’m glad you’re not a member, because I post a lot of Nazi stuff on there.'"
Stephen Colbert,"[Tearing up] I’m sorry, what? I’m sorry I’m gonna need a minute—this is a tough way for me to find out that Lords of Porno went out of business. Nobody told me. I never even got to say goodbye. Farewell, sweet Lords, may you rest in butt stuff."
Stephen Colbert,"Hey, we don’t need foreigners coming over here worrying about the prospect of another Trump presidency. That is a job Americans are willing to do."
Stephen Colbert,"Now this may shock you, but that quote is not Shakespeare. Little bit, tiny bit of it is. The words ‘well met’ appear in Shakespeare, but Hale & Hearty is a New York soup chain."
Stephen Colbert,"He might have just confused it with that other Shakespeare quote, ‘Shall I compare thee to a Panera’s bread? Thou art as soft and crusty.'"
Stephen Colbert,‘This is fun for me. It’s nice to see where all the food lives. I usually don’t get to meet it until the man comes in with my sauce-filled nuggy bucket.'
Stephen Colbert,"stuff” about five times] “Okay he clearly just forget the word popcorn. ‘Hey, it’s that stuff, I love that stuff. Let’s get some of the stuff. They gave it to me at the high level briefing about The Secret Life of Pets .'"
Stephen Colbert,"I think it’s kind of adorable that he loves a kitschy sign that much. Imagine taking Governor Walz to Marshalls. ‘Live laugh love? Look at that, finally all three together on one rustic plank! That’s awful nice right there, now if only this store sold ceramic pumpkins… whaat?!'"
Stephen Colbert,decided to run for politics
Stephen Colbert,"Oh yeah, that is suspicious, yes. I list every job I’ve ever had everywhere. If you look at my IMDb page, it says Late Show , Colbert Report , Daily Show , and cleaned eraser for Mrs. Brogden in the fifth grade."
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, uh, good luck with that. But you know even the most physically demanding jobs are easy to do for half an hour. ‘I worked down in a coal mine for, like 15 minutes. And I never got black lung, I just held my breath the whole time. Anyhoo, I’m going back up to the surface suckers. By the way, your canary died.'"
Unknown,"Donald, thank you for your support and I’m glad I have your attention. Because one in three women in this country is currently living under an abortion ban because you stacked our Supreme Court. Thanks to you, women in 21 states can’t make their own choice about their own life and their own body. And 10 U.S. states make no exceptions for rape or incest. The party you run so bigly and so beautifully, the party that cares so much about motherhood, just blocked a bill that would protect our access to IVF. Women are dying and good doctors are quitting because they can’t get or give the reproductive care that women so desperately need. So my advice to you is to shut up and go away. Far away. Go to Mar-a-Lago. Spend all day, every day cheating at golf and masturbating to Newsmax, and let a competent woman take over.” molly mcnearney"
