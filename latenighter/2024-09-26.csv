Seth Meyers,"MLK times two”] “He’s really, truly amazing. Everyone agrees that Martin Luther King is a great person, but only Trump would say, ‘I know someone twice as good! Every night he has two dreams!"
Seth Meyers,"MLK on steroids” line] “Also, it’s not 1995. We all agree steroids are bad now, right? I mean, in this hypothetical, is MLK like a strong, ‘roided-out MLK, an aggro MLK who loses it when someone coughs during his speech. ‘Hey, shut the f**k up! Shut the f**k up, I’m Martin Luther King, I’m talking about my dreams!'"
Seth Meyers,"That’s right, Robinson was scheduled to appear at a fundraiser for the Trump campaign, a get out the vote rally, and a seminar called How to Hide Your Identity Online."
Seth Meyers,"My favorite detail from this report is that Robinson used the same user name on a porn website and Pinterest. ‘We confirmed that it is indeed Mark Robinson, because after he posted on Nude Africa, he pinned some very tasteful candlesticks. Although he did post under those, ‘These candlesticks are a steal or I’m not a Black Nazi!!!'"
Seth Meyers,"‘They’re tryin’ to pretend that Trump’s involved with the Robinson guy just like my Mee-Maw’s always tryin’ to pretend she’s involved with the neighborhood watch program. They don’t want you on patrol with ya, Mee-Maw! Your orthopedic shoes make too much noise! You haven’t caught a burglar in nine years!'"
Seth Meyers,"[On Graham, with a straight face, claiming Trump had nothing to do with Mark Robinson] “That is, nothing to do with him except taking pictures with him, appearing on stage with him, endorsing him, giving him a key speaking slot at the Republican National Convention, and calling him Martin Luther King times two. I’d call Lindsey Graham a liar but he’d never tell a lie. He’s like George Washington times ten. He’s like George Washington on crack. ‘We gotta get to the other side of this river!'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today in Pittsburgh and laid our her economic plan, while Trump laid out his economic plan on QVC.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"personality defect” of needing everyone to like him] “It’s not unusual to want people to like you. I mean, some of us even choses careers where we forego making real bonds to the people closest to us so we can sit in a roomful of strangers every night hoping to entertain them—oh, f**k, Trump and I are the same."
Seth Meyers,"Everyone likes to be liked, that’s not unusual. What’s unusual is it’s the only thing you care about. Trump becomes enamored of the worst people in the world, from the Taliban to Vladimir Putin to Kid Rock if they flatter him, and he’ll get into bitter feuds with war heroes and beloved icons if they even so much as gently criticize him. This is a man who has said both that he hates Taylor Swift and that he fell in love with Kim Jong Un, even though everyone agrees his last album was bad. And I know Trump’s gonna say, ‘But did you listen to Kim’s Version?’ I did, and it’s still bad.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"It’s weird to watch him come so close to a breakthrough and then bail. ‘I always get along with the strong, the tough guys. Maybe even a little too tough, too strong, too mean. You know, mean guys who are fathers, you could say. Fathers who are tough on their kids and make their kids sad. [Long, reflective pause] Anyway, look at this crowd tonight!'"
Seth Meyers,"Is Donald Trump becoming introspective? I didn’t think it was possible, but he seems to be engaging in some actual self-reflection. Did a coconut fall on his head and change his entire personality? ‘I hate Taylor Swift, he music is overrated… [coconut clonk] But also, you know, when I listen to her, you know, when I listen to her it reminds me of times when my heart was broken, you know. Maybe if I’m being honest, my rage at Taylor is that she’s in touch with feelings that I dare not unearth. [coconut clonk] Kim Jong Un is my best friend! We have a great friendship. He’s the one who gave me this coconut tree.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"I can’t wait to see the questions at his next town hall. ‘Hi, Mr. Trump, my name’s Doctor Ziegler, I have a two-part question. What would you do about inflation, and how would you feel about starting on 20mg of Prozac?'"
Desi Lydic,"So Trump’s new conspiracy theory is that Kamala Harris never worked at McDonald’s when she was young. Which to him is basically stolen valor. ‘How dare you disrespect our men and women in uniform! Those people served with honor, and with extra ketchup packets if you asked!'"
Desi Lydic,"Did Trump just talk himself into getting hungry? ‘She never worked over the piping hot fries, so crispy and salty, each bite a perf—we should go to McDonald’s!'"
Desi Lydic,This isn’t the kind of thing you would lie about. It isn’t like having sex with a porn star while your wife is pregnant.
Desi Lydic,"Look, I get why he’s suspicious. If she’d ever worked at any McDonald’s between the years 1960 and last week, he probably would have seen her."
Desi Lydic,"‘I’m sorry, it’s too late. I’d love to have my ass handed to me for another two hours, but there’s just no time.'"
Desi Lydic,"I mean I can’t blame the guy. Drake’s not going to Kendrick like, ‘Hey, we should beef again, send me some dates.'"
Desi Lydic,"We are just 40 days away from the election, which means it’s time to start working on that insurrection body."
Desi Lydic,"But Trump is right, there are a lot of different Trump coins floating around out there, and you don’t want to be scammed by some grifter’s fake coin. You want to be scammed by Donald Trump’s fake coin."
Desi Lydic,And that’s why Trump’s coin comes with a certificate of authenticity which authentically certifies that you should not be in charge of your family’s finances.
Desi Lydic,"Now if he was just peddling this coin, I would understand. What with all the legal bills he has to pay for all the fraud and the sexual assault and the Big Macs."
Desi Lydic,That’s why people want to kill Trump? Does he think IKEA issued a fatwa on him? Although Faätjja is my favorite IKEA bookshelf.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He really should just be running for Mayor McCheese, you know?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"[On Trump admitting he lost the 2020 election “by a whisker” at an appearance this week] “Okay, good, was that so hard? I mean, he’s finally at the acceptance stage of grief. “ jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Six were eliminated, four died of natural causes."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The good news for Trump is that the reporters refuse to publish the documents because they have journalistic integrity, and because rewarding another country for hacking into a candidate’s emails would be downright un-American. [2016 clip of Trump explicitly begging Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails] I guess there’s no such thing as karma."
Jimmy Kimmel,Which is what happens when you store secret documents next to the urinal at a golf course.
Stephen Colbert,"Now our self-imposed mandate here at The Late Show is to talk about what’s going on in the news, okay. And I don’t really like to insert myself into it. But sometimes the news inserts itself into me."
Stephen Colbert,"total loser”] “Wow. In the middle of a hotly contested presidential campaign you took the time to hate-watch me on PBS? First of all [removes glasses coquettishly], I’m flattered, thank you. But more importantly, you shouldn’t be hate-watching me on PBS, you should be hate-watching me on CBS. Daddy wants the views!"
Stephen Colbert,"not wise”] [Cut to Colbert sporting white beard and smoking a pipe] “Not wise? How dare you sir! May I remind you of the immortal words of Socrates, ‘Kiss my salty man-bag you crusty old dingus.'"
Stephen Colbert,very boring”] “He’s clearly upset because I called him boring. And I called him boring because I knew it would upset him. Which I did because he’s so predictable. Which is ultimately what makes him… kind of boring.
Stephen Colbert,We are now 40 days and 40 nights away from learning whether we need to build an ark.
Stephen Colbert,The [Vice Presidential] debate is being hosted this year by CBS. Which is why the moderators this year are Tracker and the stopwatch from 60 Minutes .
Stephen Colbert,"Unlike Trump, Vance is actually preparing to debate. In his rehearsals, Walz is being played by Minnesota Representative and guy at the high school reunion reminding you of all the great times you had together, and how that guy was definitely still breathing when you left the party, remember?, Tom Emmer ."
Stephen Colbert,"Meanwhile, Walz is preparing for the debate with the help of Pete Buttigieg, who is playing Mr. Vance. It must be difficult for Buttigieg to get into character since Vance has none."
Stephen Colbert,"Thats is huge. Usually the only thing that popular at Harvard is saying you ‘went to a small college outside of Boston.’ Shut up, Ainsley, we know where you went. That’s not humble, thats worse."
Stephen Colbert,"Thank you young women, you’re going to save us all… and young men are going to play Xbox and see how high they can jump off a big rock."
Stephen Colbert,"Woo, 150. She’s trying to break Matt Gaetz’s record. I’m kidding. Obviously, I’m kidding. He’d never date a college girl . Or as he calls them, mature honeys."
Stephen Colbert,"[On Trump coins, which cost $70 more than the amount of silver used to mint them] “What a deal. ‘Uh honey, I know I bought a Trump coin at a 210 percent loss, but you can use the Trump coin to buy Truth Social stock. And once that, you know, eventually bounces back, we’ll invest the profit in an NFT trading card of his gold sneakers, which is pegged to the price of the little pieces of his suit we got from when he got arrested, then convert it to Trump crypto which we’ll use to buy Melania’s book, which is worth—get this—one Trump silver coin. Whats that suitcase for?’ stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,What was your favorite part of the ad? Mine was when the silver poop-jaculated. Don’t know what’s going on there. Or maybe that the Trump coins are made from a bar already labeled Trump coins.
Stephen Colbert,"Okay but who walks around with a silver coin in a velvet pouch? This isn’t the Middle Ages. ‘You there! I say there, you there, peasant boy, fetch me a handsome goose, for I have a silver coin emblazoned with the face of the village idiot.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Joan eliminated four of them and time took care of the other two.
Jimmy Fallon,"Yep, Biden at a museum, the jokes pretty much write themselves."
Jimmy Fallon,"Today in North Carolina, former President Trump gave a speech at a factory that makes plumbing equipment. That’s right, Trump spoke at a plumbing factory. He wasn’t expecting to but the Chipotle hit quicker than he expected."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump had a lot of questions for the workers. He was like, ‘What pipes are best for flushing classified documents?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Disney+ just launched its new password sharing program. Every customer is like, ‘Waay ahead of you.'"
