Stephen Colbert,That kind of junior high debate team sophistry is exactly the kind of behavior intelligent people use to justify evil. ‘You know what? You know when you think about it it could be argued that Godzilla really spearheaded Tokyo’s urban renewal. And he wouldn’t have to use his nuclear breath if we just had more domestic energy production.'
Stephen Colbert,"Yeah, 14 days after his plot to overthrow the election ended in a violent coup that failed. That’s like saying to your ex, ‘Barbara, I think it’s rich that you’re calling me psychotically obsessed with our relationship when I left your and Brad’s wedding peacefully. You’re the one who won’t stop talking about me setting fire to the DJ.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The point is, J.D. Vance might seem normal with the sound down and no furniture around."
Stephen Colbert,We’re all still struggling to digest last night’s Vice Presidential debate. Which is surprising because usually I have no problem eating two slices of white bread.
Stephen Colbert,"normal” last night’s debate was compared to Donald Trump’s] “Hey, you know what’s not normal? Celebrating how normal something is. ‘Uh, your special tonight is a totally normal, nothing-to-see-here piece of chicken, which is definitely not the chef’s foot that fell into a pot. It is served on a bed of Dr. Shoals—bon appé-feet.'"
Stephen Colbert,"But here’s the thing, Donald Trump hasn’t gone anywhere. He’s still the main character. This is like a scene from It without Pennywise on camera, and suddenly everyone’s like, ‘Well, I guess there’s no more scary clowns in Derry. Oooo, free sewer balloon!'"
Stephen Colbert,"Things aren’t looking great for the missing bear because it’s probable he succumbed to age, injury, or starvation somewhere in the park’s vast forests or tundra. But just to be sure, somebody check RFK Jr.’s freezer."
Stephen Colbert,"Sounds crazy, I know, But they actually did make a million Rambos. There’s Rambo First Blood , Rambo Last Blood , Rambo: Wait There’s More Blood , Rambo: That’s Just Ketchup , and Rambo: Nope It Was Blood ."
Stephen Colbert,Water-free bathrooms? Are we sure he didn’t just poop in a coat closet?
Stephen Colbert,Being good all day and then throwing in the towel and eating garbage right before bed? [Tearing up] That man is America.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He also had the audacity to say that Trump saved Obamacare, which is so brazenly false. You might as well say Trump was our first Black President."
Jimmy Kimmel,"J.D. Vance managed to present himself as polite, polished. He even had some jokes, like when he said that Trump peacefully handed over power, that was hilarious."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This is like Boeing saying, ‘We know our planes have been having some mechanical problems, but we have a solution—puffier life jackets.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump of course said Vance crushed it. He was said to be so pleased with Vance’s performance that he gifted him a $50 gift card to Sephora.'
Jimmy Kimmel,"Can you imagine calling a guy to wish him a Merry Christmas and he’s like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah—I need you to commit some treason for me. It’s Christmas treason!'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Pence was like, ‘Keep your head up,’ and Trump was like, ‘I’m gonna put your head up in a noose.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,I feel like as a country we’re not paying enough attention to the fact that the reason Mike Pence was not on the debate stage last night is that Trump tried to hang him like a human pair of TruckNutz.
Jimmy Kimmel,"We are now 33 days away from the election, we are 34 days away from Trump saying the election was rigged."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He won’t do 60 Minutes , but if there is a group of dufuses in flat-brimmed hats with a podcast where they call him bro, he will be happy to plug your energy drink on that."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I guess he learned his lesson with Eric and Don Jr, he’s pulling out."
Jimmy Kimmel,"They give each billionaire a philanthropy score. Five is the most generous when it comes to giving back, and one is Donald Trump. He really puts the ‘felon’ in ‘philanthropy.'"
Seth Meyers,"Trump came within one vote of succeeding until John McCain’s infamous thumbs-down. And I remember that vividly because I was up at 1:30 in the morning watching it live on f**king C-SPAN like the rest of the country, nervously pacing in my apartment and chain-smoking Parliaments until I remembered emphysema wouldn’t be covered if Trump repealed Obamacare."
Seth Meyers,That’s what happens when you say yes to every right-wing podcast in the universe. J.D. Vance is on record contradicting everything he says now. Politicians used to be worried about being caught on a hot mic but now they go into every McMansion basement they can find like they’re on a hot mic scavenger hunt.
Seth Meyers,"What are you talking about? He left office peacefully only because he tried to stay in office violently and failed. You don’t get credit for being faithful to your wife just because you hit on someone at a bar and they said no. ‘Is that lipstick on your collar?’ ‘Well you know it is really rich for you to ask me that, as I am currently home which means I am not with another woman.'"
Seth Meyers,"If you ask someone a straightforward question and then say I’m focused on the future,’ that’s how you know you’re caught in a lie. It’s like if you were conducting a performance review at Dairy Queen and asked one of your employees, ‘Hey Devin, before we talk about your request for a raise, did you stick your penis into the soft-serve machine, then post a video of it on TikTok and call it the Jack Frost Challenge?,’ and he said, ‘Ummmm, I’m focused on the future,’ then yes, he stuck his penis in the soft-serve machine.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,Vance is brazen and shameless but he’s admittedly smooth. He’s like a slick used car dealer that can be very convincing until you remember that the car he’s trying to sell you is an AMC Gremlin with raccoons in the engine.
Seth Meyers,"I do you”] “As someone who interviews people for a living, we don’t love it when our subjects describe the process as ‘I do you.'"
Seth Meyers,"That’s Trump’s favorite channel calling him out. That’s like if the NBC description of this show was, ‘Who are we kidding, you’re not staying up that late.'"
Michael Kosta,"I’m focused on the future? I didn’t know you could answer questions with that. You know? Next time my wife asks me why I forgot to pick up the kids I’ll say, ‘Hey—hey, hey, hey, I’m focused on the future. Where are the kids now?'"
Michael Kosta,"Or how about the next time I get pulled over? ‘Do you know how fast you were going?’ ‘I know how fast I am going, zero miles an hour. That’s got to count for something, officer.'"
Michael Kosta,"I appreciate J.D. Vance. He’s not focused on Trump trying to steal the last election, he’s focused on Trump trying to steal the next election, and honestly, that is progress."
Michael Kosta,"Great! The entire debate was pointless and irrelevant, so in a way, it really did prepare them to be Vice President."
Michael Kosta,Thank God we have all these sharp political pundits to give us a broad array of opinions. They called [J.D. Vance] slick so much that I couldn’t tell if Tim Walz was debating J.D. Vance or Moo Deng.
Michael Kosta,"Now that tweet may seem unrelated to the debate but Pete Rose was a beloved figure who played for Cincinnati, which is in Ohio, which is next to several swing states, so the calculus here is very—I’m just kidding, he was bored as sh*t."
Taylor Tomlinson,"This is like a guy getting caught cheating and being like, ‘But you said you’d never go through my phone! The trust is gone.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"And before anyone asks, yes I masturbated to this. A woman silencing men? Yeah, that’s going in the spank bank."
Taylor Tomlinson,"By the way, you know this election is scary when people are actually watching the VP debate."
Taylor Tomlinson,"This felt like when you watch a regular fantasy show after you’ve seen Game of Thrones and you’re like, ‘Okay, where’s the incest?'"
Taylor Tomlinson,I don’t think I’m alone in saying that the debate mostly made me sleepy. Which makes sense—two older white guys debating politics? That’s the original white noise machine.
Jimmy Fallon,Basically people were expecting a horror movie and instead they got a Hallmark movie.
Jimmy Fallon,"Most polls found that J.D. Vance won the debate, however all those polls were taken at a Sephora."
Jimmy Fallon,"So if you’re keeping track, Trump says he’ll stand up to the President of China but Leslie Stahl is a little too scary."
Jimmy Fallon,"California just announced that they are banning sell-by and best before food labels. Yeah, they prefer everybody to use the more scientific method of going up to their spouse and going, ‘Does this smell right to you?'"
