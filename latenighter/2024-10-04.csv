name,monologue
Stephen Colbert,We knew some of the stuff in this report already but it’s still so gratifying to read the novelization of the horror movie we all lived through.
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, it smells like consequences."
Stephen Colbert,"Pretty damning language I gotta say. But pretty weird word choice to say that Trump ‘resorted to crimes.’ That’s like saying, ‘With nowhere else to turn, the bear resorted to pooping in the woods.'"
Stephen Colbert,"And just to note, ‘resorted to crimes’ should not be confused with ‘crime resort,’ another name for Mar-a-Lago."
Stephen Colbert,"I didn’t rig the election, they did"
Stephen Colbert,"Well yeah, the man cannot handle losing anything. How did he ever handle running those pageants? ‘And the next Teen Miss USA is… me! Oh my God, I can’t believe, oh my God, I’m gonna cry. The only problem now is how do I walk into my dressing room while I’m changing .'"
Stephen Colbert,"Well I mean Star Trek makes sense. Trump clearly knew the whole thing was a grift, a fraud, a scam, uh, what’s the word I’m looking for? [Clip of William Shatner screaming, ‘Khan!!!’]"
Stephen Colbert,"At one point, Jason Miller, an adviser to Trump, makes fun of the motley crew of Trump’s legal experts, derogatorily referring to them as ‘the Star Wars bar.’ Come on, that’s not fair. The band in the Mos Eisley space port cantina looked like this [photo of Doikk Na’ts ], and Trump’s lawyers looked like [photo of Rudy Giuliani], okay yeah, I see it."
Stephen Colbert,"fight like hell” even though he lost the election] “Come on, we know who they are! This would be like if Arby’s changed their slogan to, ‘Arby’s: We have the [Redacted].'"
Stephen Colbert,"fight like hell” promise where he added that it doesn’t matter if he won or lost the election] “No, it does matter if you lose. ‘Okay, kids bring it in here. Other tee ball team beat us 5-1, but what’s important is we continue t fight like hell. Timmy, grab a bat and take out their knees.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Oh God, please, please Lord, please let it have gone to one of those spam marketing texters. ‘Oh my God, Cathy! Someone finally texted back rating their customer experience at Ann Taylor Loft! Nah, it’s just Rudy again, forget it.'"
Stephen Colbert,"is too honest” to help him deny election results] “What do you expect? Say what you want about Mike Pence—and I have—you can see that this man is a narc from low orbit. ‘I’m happy to leave a penny but taking a penny would be tantamount to stealing. And then I couldn’t sleep at night, in the twin bed next to mother’s twin bed.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"A bombshell filing in former President Trump’s election interference case was just unsealed, and it accused Trump of resorting to crimes in an effort to stay in power. I know this is going to sound controversial, but I’m just going to come out and say it—I think Trump might have done something wrong."
Jimmy Fallon,"Today when asked about Trump’s 2020 election interference, J.D. Vance said, ‘I’m focused on the future election interference.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"The news of Trump’s alleged crimes are being called an ‘October surprise,’ while most Americans are like, ‘Um, we’re not that surprised.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"According to the filing, Trump told his staff that he was going to declare victory regardless of the results. Vladimir Putin heard and was like [wipes away tears], ‘My little man is growing up.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"The filing says that on January 6, when Trump was told Mike Pence had to be taken to a secure location for his safety, his response was, ‘So what?’ To be honest, I’m more surprised Trump didn’t tweet out the secure location."
Jimmy Fallon,"[On reports that embattled New York mayor eric Adams may be facing even more charges] “Now I know this is going to be controversial, but I’m just going to come out and say it—I think Mayor Adams might have done something wrong."
Jimmy Fallon,"The makers of Ozempic were like, ‘Don’t look at us, not even we can do that.'"
Seth Meyers,"Okay, but what else happened in January? Does you’re calendar skip the sixth of every month? That’s what you get for buying those cheap Trump calendars."
Seth Meyers,"You’re leaving out the biggest part. I feel like an English teacher watching a student do an oral report on The Great Gatsby . ‘Uh, it’s about a wealthy man who throws awesome parties in the Hamptons.’ ‘And what does the green light symbolize?’ ‘Uh, the green light means go, you know? Go party more. Nothing bad ever happens if you just keep the party going.'"
Seth Meyers,"You don’t get credit for peacefully leaving a convenience store after you violently try to rob it. ‘Give me all you money!’ ‘Hey, is that a comb in your pocket?’ ‘All right, fine, you got me, it’s a comb. I’m leavin’—peacefully, I might add.'"
Seth Meyers,"Oh, I can help you with this. People are still talking about it because it was a crime. And four years is not very long when it comes to crimes. The number one show on Netflix right now is about the Menendez brothers and that was over 30 years ago."
Seth Meyers,"Also people can focus on more than one thing at a time. For instance, right now I’m reading the cue cards and trying to figure out why Corey Lewandowski here reminds me of a penis with googly eyes."
Seth Meyers,"f-ing nuts”] “But hey, maybe she meant in a new way. You know, like a movie reviewer walking out of Megalopolis . ‘This movie is f**king nuts.’ ‘In a good way?’ ‘I gotta be honest, I don’t know.'"
Seth Meyers,They actually wrote down the words ‘make them riot’ like they were Ticketmaster execs putting Sabrina Carpenter tickets up for sale.
Seth Meyers,"If Jesus came down to Earth, you’d make him count votes? May I remind you he’s the son of God, he can cure disease and walk on water, you want him doing clerical work in the Sacramento registrar’s office."
Seth Meyers,"When he saw the filing, even Jesus was like, ‘Jesus.'"
Seth Meyers,"Now here’s my biggest question? What was the Star Trek reference? Was it original series or Next Generation ? Hell, if it was DS9 , I might vote for him. Ooh, is it the famous episode where Picard tries to speak to the aliens who only speak in allegories? ‘That woman is harder to follow than Darmok and Jalad at Tenagra. It looks like her face got in the way when the walls fell.’ And guys, if you don’t get that joke you’re missing out on a classic .” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Just one problem, the message failed because he typed the wrong number into his phone. That would explain the text Rudy got back, ‘Do you want pepperoni on that?'"
Seth Meyers,"In case you don’t remember, Rudy also left a voicemail for the wrong senator on January 6, trying to get them to overturn the results. And he butt-dialed an NBC reporter discussing his need for cash and his attempt to dig up dirt on the Bidens. As a favor to Rudy, stop giving this man your phone number. The only two numbers he should have in his phone are his doctor and a liquor store that delivers.” seth meyers"
Jimmy Kimmel,The old ‘he who smelt it dealt it’ defense.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s actually right about some of that. He didn’t rig the election, he tried to rig the election and failed to rig the election. He’s a rignoramus, is what he is."
Jimmy Kimmel,"What does ‘my body, my choice’ really mean?"
Jimmy Kimmel,Melania’s views on abortion are actually very progressive. She believes women should be able to abort their stepchildren.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I guess if you’re Melania the safest place to contradict your husband is in a book, where neither he nor any of his supporters will ever see it."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The election is only 32 days away. We have two major candidates for President. One wants to take away your health care, already took away reproductive rights, was found guilty of 34 felonies with more to come, was impeached twice, and openly tried to overturn the election. The other candidate isn’t the first candidate, and that’s kind of all you need to know."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yeah, it’s quite a connection, Trump and Jesus. Where do you think Trump got the idea to sell hundred thousand dollar watches and bitcoin? From Jesus."
Michael Kosta,"You might not know this, but when you order a foam-roller or a stapler from Amazon, it’s not just magically made on your doorstep by elves. No, it’s made in China by children and then it’s put on a ship and sent to America where dockworkers take it off the ship."
Michael Kosta,"Okay, good message. Not a very easy chant. ‘We want to work! According to some schools of philosophic thought, it is man’s nature to work! But we also have material needs that must be addressed! It’s the tension between these two conflicting dynamics that has resulted in our collective labor action!'"
Michael Kosta,"cripple you” threat] “Hey man, don’t cripple me, all right? I’m not a shipping conglomerate, leave me out of it. I’m just a guy who addresses his anxiety with the mild dopamine hit of spending $70 on Amazon every day."
Michael Kosta,"Now you could argue that the phrase ‘I’ll cripple you’ is a little aggro coming from a union boss, but I’ll tell you what’s never worked. It’s when workers say, ‘Uh hi, excuse me, for-profit, multinational company? I was just kind of wondering if you had some extra money you didn’t want? Maybe we could have it?'"
Michael Kosta,"I mean, this is what I love about America. Everyone’s cool if a tech CEO or a movie star or a TikTok-er who farts on cakes has a big house. But if you’re working hard labor, they’re like, ‘You should sleep in a bunk bed at your mother’s house just like the rest of us!'"
Michael Kosta,"Despite the bad optics, the longshoremen have a lot of political support in this fight. Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are backing the striking workers, a sign that even in these polarizes time, both candidates really want to win the election in a few weeks."
Michael Kosta,"And you might be wondering, ‘How can I help support these striking dockworkers?’—Just kidding, you’re wondering, ‘Is this going to affect me?'"
Michael Kosta,"This is the last thing American democracy needed. ‘Hey honey, how did the voting go?’ ‘Ugh, I stood in line for hours, and then when I got to the booth, Tony The Shark Fin Gambino threatened to shank me if my vote doesn’t help him cover the spread.'"
