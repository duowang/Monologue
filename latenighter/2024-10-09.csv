Jordan Klepper,"Okay, so let me get this right. Every red state governor said that Biden is competently helping them. It’s clear what’s happening here.

That’s a smile that says I don’t know where I am, but I know where I want to be."
Jordan Klepper,they can control the weather
Jordan Klepper,"Do you see what’s happening? People are afraid those who are coming to help are actually coming to steal their lithium. Everyone, let’s be clear. Completely clear. The U.S. government doesn’t destroy towns to steal their resources—in the U.S. In the Middle East, sure."

Jimmy Kimmel,"I feel like the candidates are running out of ways to ask us for money. I got a fundraising email from Kamala Harris last night, it just said, ‘You up?'"
Seth Meyers,"When former President Trump falsely claimed in a new interview that Vice President Kamala Harris had not visited areas devastated by Hurricane Helene, Fox News host Laura Ingraham fact-checked him and said, ‘She was there today for three hours.’ Imagine being such a liar that you get fact-checked by Laura Ingraham.

Stephen Colbert,bye to a piece of sh*t
Stephen Colbert,"That’s gotta be a little confusing for Trump voters. ‘I’m fightin’ for the little guy. And you know how much I hate immigrants.
