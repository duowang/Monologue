name,monologue
Stephen Colbert,"I just wanna say, I’ve been watching elections pretty closely during my TV career. This Thursday will be 19 years since the start of doing a late-night show. So by now I think I have the experience and discernment to say, with the deepest gravity, last night’s Trump town hall was bananapants-boo-boo-bonkers."
Stephen Colbert,"I’m not so sure ‘Ave Maria’ is the song you want to play when someone’s condition is unclear because they are unconscious on the floor. ‘All right, can we put on ‘Ave Maria?’ And tell you what, let’s get some coins on his eyes so he can pay the ferryman on the river Styx. I hope he’s okay, but just in case, pull out his brains through his nose with a silver hook and then rinse his body with wine and spices and start packing his cavities with salt.'” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Ave Maria’ again. C’mon, c’mon, at least switch up your sad music. At least give ‘em ‘Danny Boy’ or maybe this cheerful tune [Pac Man dying sound.]"
Stephen Colbert,"Now, watching an elderly man sway to Vatican elevator music for 40 minutes might make you wonder, ‘Is he okay?'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘What the f**k, Jack? You sonsabitches kicked me out of the race for being too old and crazy? That guy’s doing the dayroom shuffle to ‘November Rain.'"
Stephen Colbert,get grandpa back on track
Stephen Colbert,"Trump closed out the event with some handshaking to another beloved song, ‘Memory,’ which of course is from his favorite musical, They’re Eating the Cats! “ stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"You know what, I tell you what. It’s rare that I agree with Donald Trump, but I’m a big enough man to admit when I do. I’m with him on this one. So to all of his supporters, please… do not forget to vote on January 5th."
Stephen Colbert,put out more Medical Exams than any other President in History
Stephen Colbert,"‘Imagine this. Kamala is meeting with the Saudi ambassador. She sneezes. He says ‘Bless you’—Boom, she’s a Muslim. It’s true, it could happen. That’s how they got Obama.'"
Stephen Colbert,"hard-hitting” Fox journalist] “He’s right, Fox has plenty of hard-hitting journalist to pick from. There’s Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, and the puppet from Saw . ‘And now over to Sam with the weather, which I have buried in his abdomen.'"
Desi Lydic,‘Anybody else want to pull focus with their medical emergency? Get it out of the way?'
Desi Lydic,"Calm down Donald, no one was trying to faint. Trust me, no one wants to have a medical emergency in front of Kristi Noem. She’s just looking for an excuse to take you to the gravel pit. She cocked her shotgun when she heard Kamala had allergies."
Desi Lydic,"Wow, ‘Ave Maria,’ huh? You sure you don’t want to get the crowd hyped with some Gregorian chants?"
Desi Lydic,Why does Trump know so much about ‘Ave Maria?’ Was it used in a McDonald’s commercial?
Desi Lydic,"Man, he really loves that song. Who’s gonna tell him it’s about a virgin?"
Desi Lydic,"And look at poor Kristi Noem. I gotta say, this is the most I’ve ever related to her. ‘Cause we have all been in a situation where a guy mansplains his Spotify playlist to you."
Desi Lydic,"I love how everybody’s always criticizing Kamala for not being specific with her policies. Meanwhile, Trump’s like, ‘Shh-shh-shh, no questions, no talking. We’re just gonna vibe for a while.'"
Desi Lydic,"Probably a good idea to shut down questions since I’m pretty sure the next one would have been, ‘Uh, sir—what the f**k is going on?'"
Desi Lydic,"I’m sorry, Donald Trump ‘has more strength and stamina than any politician in history?’ I’d put a hundred bucks on Jimmy Carter taking Trump in a push-up contest today ."
Desi Lydic,"Oh my God! She has allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, the medical term for hay fever? Is there a priest on call? She doesn’t have long!"
Desi Lydic,"That is how healthy Kamala Harris is. Donald Trump is reduced to calling her allergies ‘a very messy and dangerous situation.’ Although in fairness to Trump it’s a woman sneezing, so that makes it more disgusting. A sneeze is the period of the face."
Desi Lydic,Now we all know that Donald Trump suffers from epidermal fragility but we don’t know anything more because he’s never released his medical records.
Desi Lydic,"Ass-your-Asians”] “I can’t believe Trump is inventing new races, he doesn’t even like the old ones."
Jimmy Kimmel,He played music and kind of did that baby toddler jumping dance that he does for a full 39 minutes.
Jimmy Kimmel,He just stood there swaying like a manatee tangled in seaweed.
Jimmy Kimmel,Why remain on stage for 30 minutes? Just pretend it was one of Don Jr.’s piano recitals and leave.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I want you to imagine a world in which Kamala Harris just stood there at a rally and said nothing, just danced around for almost 40 minutes. Fox News would have—they would have blocked out a full week to cover it. It would have been like the O.J. chase meets 9/11 all at once."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This guy, he wasn’t healthy enough to be in the military during the draft, but 60 years later he’s the healthiest man alive."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You can’t be President with hay fever. What if the Russians bombard the White House with hay? My God, you’d have to bring in Seal Team Zyrtec."
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump actually knows a lot about skin conditions. He suffers from having the thinnest skin of any person ever.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I did him a lot,” referring to his pre-politics three Jimmy Kimmel Live appearances over the years] “Maybe confusing me with Stormy Daniels, I don’t know."
Jimmy Kimmel,"And by every time, he means no times. He loves telling this made up story. Never did I ever stand on the sidewalk to greet Donald Trump. Or any guest, never happened. You guys here in the studio have been out on that sidewalk, you think I’m going out there? No way."
Jimmy Kimmel,The only time I’ve ever walked out on the sidewalk for Donald Trump was to urinate on his star on the Walk of Fame.
Jimmy Kimmel,"We get a lot of people watching this show on YouTube from around the world, and for those who are watching from another country right now—Please, come help us."
