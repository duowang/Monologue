Desi Lydic,"In the race for President there are certain demographics that the candidates can depend on. For instance, Donald Trump has locked down evangelicals, blue collar men, teenage boys who call their mom ‘bitch,’ frat boys who sing the n-word in rap songs, and Americans who consider Joe Rogan their primary care physician."
Desi Lydic,"In the past few days, Kamala has gone on The Breakfast Club , Roland Martin, The Shade Room —all the shows that make your racist uncle lock the car doors when they come on the radio."
Desi Lydic,"And legalizing weed should be popular too. But Kamala is a former prosecutor, so it’s always a little suspicious when a cop approaches Black men to offer them marijuana. ‘Psst, hey I heard you guys like drugs.'"
Desi Lydic,I think this was the first time someone told an entire demographic it was grounded.
Desi Lydic,"And I feel bad for the guys in that room. They were like, ‘President Obama’s coming in today, what’s he gonna talk about?’ ‘How much you suck sh*t!'"
Desi Lydic,I love Black men” upon polls showing he’s attracting less than 20 percent of them] “‘Black men.’ ‘Black men.’ He says it like he’s been practicing really hard not to call them something else.
Desi Lydic,It’s a reminder of the good old days when men were men and women weren’t allowed to vote.
Desi Lydic,"And I know what you’re thinking, ‘But Desi, he’s groped so many women.’ I know, and yet he trails."
Desi Lydic,"But then it comes to women voters, Trump is polling slightly below a yeast infection."
Desi Lydic,I’m the father of IVF
Desi Lydic,"So Darth Trump is IVF’s father, I didn’t see that coming."
Desi Lydic,"Yes as everyone knows, the President has three major responsibilities. Commanding the military, signing bills into law, and personally managing the rules for every JV field hockey team. It’s right there in the Constitution on page What the F**k Are You Talking About?"
Jimmy Kimmel,This is the first time Groper Cleveland has been around this many women since they started padlocking the doors at Miss Teen USA .
Jimmy Kimmel,"Now he’s claiming to be the father of IVF, which has been happening since 1978. This guy won’t even admit to being the father of Eric."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This town hall, it was in two parts. In the first part, the women asked questions. In the second part, Trump went through and rated them physically from one to 10."
Jimmy Kimmel,If you’re still watching this on your television it means that grandpa didn’t shoot it I guess.
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump has said that Fox has grown ‘so weak and soft’ on the Democrats. Which is—it’s true. They barely accuse us of eating babies any more.
Jimmy Kimmel,"One of the people who’s been challenging the Vice President’s employment history is Trump’s campaign spokesman, this guy Steven Cheung . Which is ironic because he looks like what would happen if you skinned Grimace. JIMMY KIMMEL"
Jimmy Kimmel,But this is a win-win for Trump because working the deep fryer will give him a new skill he could potentially put to use in the prison cafeteria.
Jimmy Kimmel,And the reason we celebrate it is because we are a real bunch of ass-kissers here.
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know, some believe that if any car explodes, you’re dead. Gasoline isn’t exactly something you fill the pool with."
Stephen Colbert,"You know how a couple of days ago, Trump had this musical tribute to cognitive decline? Well, at the Chicago Economic Club, he acted like a guy who really woke up on the wrong side of the dementia."
Stephen Colbert,68 percent. 68! It should enrage all Americans that they couldn’t add one more point and make that number nice . If you know what I mean. Nice. [Holds out hand] Peabody please.
Stephen Colbert,"And folks wonder why I don’t want to have that charmer back on my show. Can you imagine him taking the Colbert Questionert ? ‘What happens after we die? I don’t die. You all die. I’m the only one who’s real. But when you do die, I put on ‘Ave Maria’ and I have a little dance like this.'"
Stephen Colbert,tariff is my favorite word
Stephen Colbert,"Sure, after your violent coup failed. That’s just like the famous words of Jefferson Davis, ‘Ultimately we all agreed to end slavery. Smoke bomb!'"
Stephen Colbert,I didn’t do it—but it’d be super-great if I did do it. I totally did it.
Stephen Colbert,"Oh hell yeah. You go Georgia. I say Georgia, you’ve always been one of my favorite southern states, right after Mississippi. I mean, the curves on that river. I mean, is there a Mister Ssippi?"
Stephen Colbert,"Because Americans show up for only two things: to defend their civil rights and when Hailey Bieber launches a skin care pop-up. If you’re in that line, stay in that line—what are the chances you’re ever going to find lotion again in your life?"
Stephen Colbert,You are now my favorite Carter! Deal with it Beyoncé.
Stephen Colbert,"Okay that’s great, but also, Shhhhh. Don’t let Georgia Republicans hear that voting is easy this year. They’ll put the ballot box on top of the American Ninja Warrior salmon ladder."
Stephen Colbert,"shall certify,” as in, “You shall not pass"
Stephen Colbert,"Well, if you’re asking seriously, I would say it’s his narcissistic personality disorder exacerbated by the cruelty of a father who saw his son not as a person in need of love but as an extension of his own inadequacies, and now as he reaches his twilight years, the personality disorder is amplifying symptoms of dementia, which makes sense given that some studies have shown narcissists may be more prone to Alzheimers because their brains are wired to be inward-focused and less stimulated by social connection. Plus, he’s got a big old butt and it makes him walk funny.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,Tim Walz gets more Midwestern with each appearance. At this point by election day’s he’s gonna be breaded and deep-fried.
Stephen Colbert,"It’s pretty funny stuff if he wasn’t trying to (insert terrible Trump proposals on women’s rights, healthcare, etc.)"
