Desi Lydic,"Now Kamala’s lion’s den was Fox News, where she sat down with Bret Baier, so maybe it was a Baier’s den? It doesn’t matter what animal it was, the point is it was very tense."
Desi Lydic,"Yes, both Kamala and Trump went into the lion’s den this week. Although they only got Trump there by telling him it was the name of a strip club."
Desi Lydic,"Sorry, can we get that mute button from the debate so she can complete a sentence?"
Desi Lydic,"C’mon Bret, you invited her on to speak with you. This is an interview with the Vice President, not sex with your wife. You have to let the woman finish."
Desi Lydic,"stupid”] “C’mon Bret, that was such an obvious trap. ‘Now Madame Vice President, just put on this ‘I’m With Stupid’ t-shirt and stand next to this map of the United States."
Desi Lydic,"So that was Kamala’s experience in the lion’s den, an interview with a news network that openly serves as the propaganda arm of her opponent. But Trump also faced down his biggest fear—Hispanic people."
Desi Lydic,"For most of this campaign, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have stuck to doing friendly interviews. Kamala Harris has gone on MSNBC and The View , and Donald Trump has gone on outlets favorable to him, like Newsmax and the No Fatties podcast with the Roofie Bros, sponsored by creatine."
Desi Lydic,"a day of love”] “Oh, I know that look. That’s the look your dad gives you when you’ve obviously been lying to him. ‘No dad, actually they switched all the grades around so now F is the highest. Anyway, before you go out to the garage, I don’t know where the car is.'"
Desi Lydic,"January 6 was ‘a day of love.’ Sure we all remember January 6. That was the day countless rioters found their soulmates. Wait, I read that wrong—cellmates."
Desi Lydic,"Nothing done wrong. And action was taken, strong action. Ashli Babbitt was killed, nobody was killed…"
Stephen Colbert,"Yesterday, Kamala Harris entered the belly of the beast and then cut herself out with a rusty spoon in an interview with Fox News anchor and Botox that’s had some man done, Bret Baier."
Stephen Colbert,"I want to be clear about this. I believe that journalists should always ask the toughest questions of presidential candidates, and Bret Baier certainly plays a convincing journalist on Fox News."
Stephen Colbert,"uncomfortable”] “But as we learned in the aftermath of the Dominion suit against Fox, when the rubber hits the road, Bret’s ready to throw the journalism under the bus."
Stephen Colbert,"Yeah. You ask a question, you have to let her answer. Does he think he’s interviewing himself? ‘Your hair is looking particular snapped-on today, Bret.’ ‘Why thank you, Bret.’ ‘My pleasure, Bret.’ ‘Who’s that lady talking over there?’ ‘I’m Kamala Harris.’ ‘Excuse me, I was talking to Bret.’ You scratch her eyes out, Bret.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The whole quote makes it a little different, doesn’t it buddy? Though without the whole quote it sounds relatively sane. It’s like if you only watch the first ten minutes of Jurassic Park you think, ‘That place looks like a lot of fun. Tell you what, let’s load up the kids in the Land Rover, stuff their pockets with goat meat and go throw rocks at the T-Rex.'"
Stephen Colbert,"She’s right, he did not show what he was talking about. Though in his defense, maybe he couldn’t see the clips because his eyes are two dehydrated blueberries."
Stephen Colbert,"No they’re not stupid, Bret. They’ve just been watching your network and your network feeds them lies. It’s like Taco Bell asking, ‘Why do all these people have diarrhea?’ It’s you guys! You’re the diarrhea factory!"
Stephen Colbert,‘Why are these people junkies? All we do is feed them heroin.'
Stephen Colbert,[After a clip showed Trump freezing and weaving in place while the Univision announcer greeted the audience in Spanish] “I’d like to point out that that there is no difference between his nervous swaying to Spanish and his dancing to ‘Ave Maria.’ “ stephen colbert
Stephen Colbert,All I do is report”] “All he does is report rumors he sees online. It reminds me of Walter Cronkite’s famous sign-off. [Dubbed clip of the legendary CBS newsman] ‘And that’s the Facebook post I saw on my aunt’s coworker’s news feed.'
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s cancelled a number of high-profile television appearances in favor of cozy, friendly chats with the wannabe Bro Rogans of the podcasting world."
Jimmy Kimmel,"we,” and claiming “the others had guns"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Oh my God, it was like whole row of Melanias looking at him."
Jimmy Kimmel,She seems to have a nice way about her
Jimmy Kimmel,"Which to me is a lot of money to pay a person you didn’t have sex with to not tell anyone you had sex with them. She already told us he’s bad in bed and hung like a baby mushroom, I don’t know what more she could have to reveal."
Jimmy Kimmel,"foreign actors” with a grudge hacked the documents Maddow uncovered about the scheme] “Hmm, I wonder if there are any foreigners who are still upset with Donald Trump over the Stormy Daniels thing? [Shows photo of a scowling Melania Trump] Oh yes, right, there is that one."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I actually got one myself last week. It said, ‘Friend, you’re invited to Mar-a-Lago.’ Which for me feels like a trap ."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Some of these clubs claim that members get the opportunity to give Trump advice in person, which is obviously not hap—would you take advice from a person you juts scammed out of their vacation money?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s right, travel 5,000 miles to share a teabag with a douchebag."
Jimmy Kimmel,"From 40 contests, the only winners the campaign confirmed was a man named William McGuffin and his son who got to meet Trump at a Formula One race. That was it. And the only reason they got that is that Trump probably thought they were bringing him a McMuffin and misunderstood."
Jimmy Kimmel,"We’re now 18 days away from the election, and 95 days from our next insurrection."
Jimmy Kimmel,"For reasons I cannot begin to fathom, the race is very close. The pollsters are calling it a toss-up, as in, ‘I’m about to toss up my lunch from this election already.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"a fertile mind”] “It’s very fertile, it’s literally full of fertilizer."
