Michael Kosta,"In the home stretch of the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump has gained a critical new supporter, Elon Musk. A man of gravitas, a man of dignity, a man with roughly a four-inch vertical leap, and president of the funny tummy club."
Michael Kosta,"But of course billionaires in politics isn’t anything new. Democrats have George Soros and Mark Cuban. Republicans have Steve Wynn , Dan Snyder , and I think the Monopoly man?"
Michael Kosta,"Wow, Elon’s giving a million dollars to his fans. Now they can afford the best anime girlfriend pillow money can buy."
Michael Kosta,"So that’s how uncharismatic Elon Musk is. He can hand someone a million dollars and they’re just like, ‘Sooo, can I just go now, because…’ I’ve seen people more excited to win a dishwasher on The Price Is Right ."
Michael Kosta,"And fun fact, he wanted to call his PAC @America on Twitter but somebody else already had that handle. So he just took it from them. He literally stole America."
Michael Kosta,"He couldn’t have given them a cooler handle than that? Give ‘em @HenryKissinger, he’s not using that any more."
Michael Kosta,"Holy sh*t, 3.3 billion views for conspiracies and misinformation? And yes, a billion or two of those views come from sex bots who only tweet things like ‘Click here to see crypto in my pu**y,’ but that’s still a huge amount of propaganda."
Michael Kosta,"55 percent of the posts had misinformation, so he’s wrong half the time. Well thank God he only controls Twitter and not some sort of rocket company."
Michael Kosta,"If you’re on Twitter like me, you know that he doesn’t just tweet the stuff out to your followers. He puts it in your feed whether you follow him or not. It’s gotten so bad that the other day I almost closed Twitter and talked to my family. Can you imagine?"
Michael Kosta,"Yeah that tracks. I mean if you’ve never heard of something, you don’t need it, right? I mean seriously, the parietal lobe? I’ve never heard of it. Don’t need it."
Michael Kosta,"Oh poor Rudy. Poor, poor Rudy. And I’m not expressing empathy by the way, I’m saying Rudy is literally poor now."
Michael Kosta,"He’s got to give them his apartment, his car, his furniture, even his TV. Do you know how badly you have to lose a court case that 9/11 is the second worst thing that’s ever happened to you?"
Michael Kosta,It really makes you realize how random justice is in this country. This man lost his entire fortune for trying to steal the election while the man he was trying to steal the election for has faced no repercussions at all. It’s like when I get yelled at for going to the strip club even though there were 45 men also at the strip club. Why doesn’t my wife yell at them?

Stephen Colbert,"Of course men plan to vote at 6:45 on Election Night and show up with a gift that they obviously bought at the gas station. ‘But babe, I thought you loved windshield wiper fluid. It’s blue, isn’t this the stuff you guys pour on your pads?'"
Stephen Colbert,"After tonight, there’s only one Taco Tuesday left until Election Day. And please savor it because I’m pretty sure if Trump wins, Project 2025 outlaws tacos. All you’ll be able to eat is a spiced meat foldy sandwich."
Stephen Colbert,Wow. Sad. But also other feelings.
Stephen Colbert,"Over on the Republican side, Trump is raising less money that he did did during his run in 2020, mainly because his contributions from small-dollar donors have plummeted. Well of course they have. They’ve got no money left. They already spent it all on sneakers, Bibles, watches, silver coins, NFTs, Trump’s new book, Melania’s new book, and Eric’s new ‘zine, a printout of his face smushed on the copier.” stephen colbert"

Stephen Colbert,Graham Slaham” graphics] “What’s the difference between Lindsey Graham and a book? Books have spines.
Stephen Colbert,"I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be so mean to you, Senator. If I keep bullying you like this, you’ll endorse me for president."
Jimmy Fallon,"According to a new poll, over 70 percent of Americans are stressed about the election. Americans were like, ‘You know what isn’t helping? Calling all day and asking if I’m stressed about the election.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, Election Day is almost here and there are two possible outcomes. Trump wins and Harris concedes. Or Harris wins and Trump claims that people in Ohio ate the votes."
Jimmy Fallon,Today Trump abruptly cancelled a virtual town hall called Make America Healthy Again. Tough to make Make America Healthy Again when you were just making them french fries a day ago.
