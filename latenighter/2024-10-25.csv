Michael Kosta,"I spent a weekend in Pennsylvania recently and every single commercial break it was Kamala-Trump, Kamala-Trump and on and on. I actually wept tears of joy when a Kars 4 Kids ad came on, and then one of those kids said, ‘Kamala Harris wants to turn me trans’ and then I realized it was just another campaign ad, Jesus Christ."
Michael Kosta,Irritable bowel syndrome? This election is so scary Americans are literally sh*tting themselves.
Michael Kosta,"Are we really stealing signs now? You know that person can still vote. It’s not like if you take the sign off their lawn they’ll be like, ‘Huh, I forgot who to vote for. What’s that sign say, deer crossing? I guess I’ll vote for deer crossing.'"
Michael Kosta,"You’re giving them attitude for the stuff your son stole? That’s the law and order party for you. ‘No see, when we commit crimes it’s funny, okay?'"
Michael Kosta,"Aw, Make America Cute Again. Seriously, you call that a MAGA flag? Good luck beating a police officer unconscious with that."
Michael Kosta,"Wooo, talk about a get! The last time Beyoncé appeared on stage with a presidential candidate was Hillary in 2016, so things are looking good!"
Michael Kosta,"Hey, I don’t want to be a hater. He’s excited for his first political rally. It seems like a personally reasonable time to laugh like a villain in an old timey movie who tied a woman to the railroad tracks."
Michael Kosta,"This might be why you’ve never been invited to speak at a political rally before. You see, America, these people are not weird. They just know that Trump is a big strong daddy who’s coming home to spank us all, totally normal stuff."
Michael Kosta,"I can’t wait to hear Tucker’s thoughts on the economy. ‘Inflation is like a babysitter, and she’s been naughty .'"
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, Halloween and the election are almost here so whether it’s trick-or-treaters or campaign workers, when that doorbell rings you hit the lights and pretend you’re not home. jimmy fallon"
Jimmy Fallon,"What a night: the most powerful woman in the world, and Kamala Harris."
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, Beyoncé will sing ‘Irreplaceable,’ and Biden will be like, ‘Too soon.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Yep, Harris is rallying with Beyoncé while Trump will be onstage claiming migrants are eating Snoop Dogg and Doja Cat."
Jimmy Fallon,"Tonight’s rally featured Obama, Springsteen, Spike Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tyler Perry. Or they were all just Tyler Perry."
Jimmy Fallon,This week Venom: The Last Dance hits theaters. I’m excited although I hope it stays true to the Jane Austen novel it’s based on.
Jimmy Fallon,"American Airlines is testing a new technology to stop passengers from boarding early. Meanwhile Spirit is like, ‘Weird, we don’t have that problem.'"
Stephen Colbert,"So in eleven days, we all get to find out finally whether we all live in a fascist country. I’m not saying that’s a good feeling, but definitely the feeling."
Stephen Colbert,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is late October. You know, they call it the spooky season. Soon all the ghastly ghouls will be roaming the streets of New York, ‘cause on Sunday, Donald Trump will hold a rally at Madison Square Garden."
Stephen Colbert,"Yeah, just what New Yorkers need, more garbage around Penn Station."
Stephen Colbert,"I’m sure that it’s just a coincidence that in 1939 they held a pro-Nazi rally there. Yeah, it was a stain on MSG’s history and I imagine a very uncomfortable courtside seat for Spike Lee."
Stephen Colbert,"Trailing by 19 points, or as the New York Jets say, ‘Not bad.'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘They told me I’m behind in Wisconsin, so I’m rallying in Madison… Square Garden. No, it works. After that, I’ll hit Philadelphia… Cream Cheese.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The big news continues to be that Trump’s former Chief of Staff John Kelly said that Trump is a fascist who loves Hitler. Well at least he’s not a fascist who loves Hitler—what’s that? I’m sorry, hold on a second, I’m being told that’s exactly what I just read out loud but my brain refused to receive the sounds my mouth was making. Okay, got it."
Stephen Colbert,"That’s gonna be a hot concert, baby. They’re gonna sing a duet on the Springsteen classic, ‘Born to Run, But I’ve Already Had Two Terms.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Today Harris got a big thumbs-up from 82 American Nobel Prize winners endorsing Harris, writing, ‘This is the most consequential presidential election in a long time, perhaps ever, for the future of science.’ So no big deal, but the smartest people on Earth fear for the end of science. And I for one would miss everything that science has given us, from germ theory to the light bulb to the Smuckers Uncrustable.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"As Charles Darwin might say, ‘Trump might win? Screw it, I’m going back to being a monkey. Ooh ooh. Ah Ah.'"
Stephen Colbert,"This group has some heavy hitters in the brain department, vaccine developer Drew Weissman, economist Claudia Goldin, and one prominent scientist even released this fiery statement: [Picture of Muppet Beaker] ‘Mee-mee mee-mee mee-mee-mee mee, Jeffrey Epstein.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Not to fact-check you there, Tuck, but we know from Stormy Daniels that daddy’s the one who likes to get spanked."
Stephen Colbert,"[After Carlson’s alarmingly detailed fantasies of disrespectful young women being violently spanked back into submissiveness by a stern daddy figure] “Everything at home okay, Tuck? ‘If you allow your teenagers to wait ’til you fall asleep on the couch and then draw a penis on your forehead with a Sharpie and when you ask ‘Who did this?,’ they just laugh and say, ‘Oh my God, the penis just got a vein in it because dad is so angry.’ And if you say, ‘There will be consequences,’ and then you fall and bang your actual penis on the corner of the coffee table because they tied your shoes together, and you’re so startled you let out a big fart and then your wife starts laughing too, and then they post it all online and now you’re going viral as #PenisFartDad, I’m telling you, I’m telling you, you’re gonna get more of it.'” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"I gotta say that was an upsetting little monologue. Daddy’s punishing little girls? I’m guessing when Tucker wrote that, he was vigorously spanking something."
Seth Meyers,"During last night’s CNN town hall, Kamala Harris said she prays daily. While the rest of us have bumped it up to hourly."
Seth Meyers,"[On Harris’ late push for undecided voters] “Though I think talking to voters who are undecided at this point Is like watching a movie with your mom. ‘Wait, who’s that lady? Are we supposed to know her? Who’s that guy? I thought he died in that car accident.'"
Seth Meyers,"Anyway, here’s a sentence no one ever wants to say—Back to the Hitler story!"
Seth Meyers,"The political world is still reeling from reports that Trump repeatedly praised Hitler and Hitler’s generals. [Turns to camera two] I know when I say ‘reeling,’ no one’s actually reeling. They’re mostly just shrugging because we live in a nightmare world where this has somehow become normal and everyone just goes about their day knowing that the most powerful person on earth could once again be the one who thinks Hitler was cool. Because it’s just another piece of content we all scroll past on our magic little distraction boxes between cooking trends and TikTok dances and dogs wearing sunglasses. [Photo of French bulldog in sunglasses with word bubble reading Raise the woof!] But come on! Look at this guy he’s so cute, he’s wearing aviators just like a person and it’s funny because they’re almost as big as his head and it looks like he’s at a pool party instead of ‘Raise the woof!’ And I’m gonna send this to my family group chat and, wait a second what was I talking about? Oh yeah, Trump…praising… Hitler. F**k!” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"[After a news clip segueing from the fact that the GOP candidate for president loves Hitler to news about Eminem stumping for Kamala Harris] “No, you can’t follow up a story as insane as ‘presidential candidate praises Hitler’ with fun wordplay about Eminem. If the first story is the next president could be a Hitler lover, then just, you know, don’t have a second story. That’s enough to fill an hour. What are you gonna do if a world war breaks out? ‘A nuclear exchange has begun between the world’s major powers threatening to end life on Earth as we know it. And hi, my name is—what?—my name is—who?—my name is Ling-Ling, the newest panda at the National Zoo.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"And look, I get it can be tough to cover something like this because, as with all Trump revelations, it’s both shocking and not at all surprising. So we’re left in this weird middle ground where you’re left reporting something that everybody basically knows already but it’s also insane. It’s like going through a haunted house with a group of friends who used to work there. ‘You guys! A zombie with a chainsaw just popped out from behind that broken mirror!’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s Scott—what’s up Scott? New chainsaw? Dope.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Plus, guys, a lot of crazy sh*t’s happening. This week alone, so much is happening we didn’t even have time to talk about the Department of Justice warning Elon Musk that his million dollar giveaway to voters in swing states could be illegal, or Rudy Giuliani being told to hand over his possessions, including his watches, Yankee memorabilia, and his Manhattan apartment to the two Georgia election workers he defamed. That story made us so happy but we had not time for it. Do you know how it pains us not to talk about Rudy when something hilarious happens to him?” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,Vice President Harris yesterday criticized former President Trump over reports that he has repeatedly praised Adolph Hitler in private. And if you think that’s bad you should hear some of the stuff he says in public.
Seth Meyers,"Why do you keep calling him ‘fierce’ like you’re judging him on an episode of Project Runway ? ‘And I went to China and I met with President Xi, and I looked him right in the eye, and I said to him, ‘Make it work.'"
Seth Meyers,"Trump’s repeatedly and openly praised dictators as brilliant for ruling with an iron fist and, let me just say, ruling with an iron fist doesn’t make you brilliant. That’s easy. You know what’s hard? Navigating a messy, complicated pluralistic democracy with 50 states, 435 congressional districts, 15 executive departments, 13 appellate courts, three branches of government, two chambers of congress and one really [expletive] fry cook.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"baked in” to the choice to support Trump] “Republicans are already dismissing it as less of a blockbuster and more of a ‘Who cares, buster?'"
Seth Meyers,"His love of Adolph Hitler is baked in? That’s like saying, ‘Look, that dead rat is baked into this loaf of sourdough. What are you gonna do, go all the way back to the bakery?’ If it’s baked in then don’t eat the thing it’s baked into."
Seth Meyers,"This is not a complicated story. Trump is a fascist who likes other fascists and wants to emulate fascism. If you’re shrugging that off as baked in then you’re just saying you’re okay with fascism. If you’re still supporting Trump, just admit it, you think fascism’s cool, it’s awesome, it’s [clip of Trump saying ‘fierce’]."
Seth Meyers,"[After playing John Kelly’s extended quote explaining exactly why Donald Trump is a fascist] “And if all those words are too much for you, you could also just look at a single picture of Trump’s face when he’s with someone like Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong Un, or Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Just for comparison, here he is next to democratically elected Angela Merkel. [Picture of a glum Trump sitting beside Merkel] ‘When they said the German Chancellor was coming, you are not what I was expecting.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Wow, I guess for my part I’m just glad he’s standing behind a podium. Most people just clear their browser history, they don’t put it in their speeches."
Seth Meyers,"A woman in Bangladesh recently set the Guinness world record for most grains of rice eaten one at a time with chopsticks. ‘Cool,’ said the couple waiting for the table."
Seth Meyers,"American Airlines has begun testing a new boarding system, while Frontier is sticking with knife fights."
Seth Meyers,"Former President Trump reportedly met with Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch and asked that the network go easier on him. Easier, how could they be any easier? Bravo is tougher on Andy Cohen."
Seth Meyers,"While speaking last night at a rally in Georgia, former President Trump told his supporters that they have no idea what he did in the White House and said, ‘I stopped wars with France.’ Though I think that’s the kind of stuff they had to tell him to get him to sign papers."
