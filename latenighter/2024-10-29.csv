Stephen Colbert,"That is just sad, to see an old man like that. We’ve all had that moment when you have to look at your grandpa and say, ‘Pee-Paw, it’s just not safe any more. We’re gonna have to take away the keys to your shirt.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Buddy, you don’t get to call something else a floating pile of garbage when you are standing on top of Penn Station. They clean off the pee with fresher pee."
Stephen Colbert,"You’re not gonna win over half a million people by insulting their homeland. That’s why William Henry Harrison dropped his original slogan, ‘Tippecanoe and Don’t Trust the Irish!'"
Stephen Colbert,"You can hear all about it on JLo’s new track, ‘Love Don’t Cost a Thing, But That Joke Might Cost You Buck’s County.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Then it was off to the racists, with over four hours of MAGA speakers before Trump shambled on stage. Including, among the speakers, disgraced and discarded former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani. Who shared his message of, ‘Can I sleep here?'"
Stephen Colbert," WaPo ’s opinion editor said of the decision, ‘The Post was no longer going to tell people how to vote, a posture that would reflect the paper’s independent bona fides.’ Okay, counterpoint-You’re the opinion editor! Your whole job is to have an opinion on about important stuff like this! That would be like a movie critic writing, ‘I give Megalopolis thumbs. To say how many or which direction they’re pointing would ruin my independent bona fides. Adam Driver gives a performance.'” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"What’s extra sinister about this is that the paper had an endorsement for Harris written and ready to go. But at the last minute, it apparently got yanked by the paper’s owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Well that’s it, I am going to shred my collection of Washington Posts . [Takes out phone] Okay, Amazon.com… and ooo, paper shredders! And two-day shipping. And you know, I do need refills on the Nespresso…” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"Turns out refusing to express an opinion on a looming fascist regime is pretty unpopular among newspaper subscribers. Because as of this taping, 200,000 people have cancelled their digital subscriptions to the Washington Post . 200,000 gone. 200,000! You can’t lose those kind of people. If this keeps up, it could destroy the Washington Post . Now is that a good thing or a bad thing? I have no opinion.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"We are one week from an election in which Americans will learn a lot about ourselves as a country. We’ll be standing in front of the full-length mirror of democracy, buck naked. And we’re gonna get an eyeful of just how far we’ve let ourselves go."
Stephen Colbert,"Yeah it’s not right. And you know grandmas’ just gonna rub it in. ‘We didn’t just have reproductive rights. Houses were $15 dollars, smoking made you live longer, and instead of dating apps I just married the first sailor who bought me a gin rickey.'"
Seth Meyers,"Oof, that was like watching my kids trying to take off a sweater. ‘There’s a zipper! Just undo the zipper! You look like you’re having a hockey fight with yourself.'"
Seth Meyers,"It’s so unsettling when wrestlers can’t land their signature move. It’d be like Dwayne Johnson yelling, ‘Can you smell what the Rock is cooking? I can’t because it’s allergy season, I’m all stuffed up!'"
Seth Meyers,Do you know how bad something has to be for the Trump campaign to distance themselves from it? Trump won’t even distance himself from Hannibal Lecter. He’s bragging about how similar he is to Scarface.
Seth Meyers,"Oh my God, it’s looks like someone’s trying to get their own Magic the Gathering card."
Seth Meyers,"I’m not trying to be difficult here but is the difference between MAGA and Dark Gothic MAGA the hat being black? Is that why you’re pointing at the hat? No one’s ever cool pointing at a hat. ‘Uh, I think you’ll find I am World’s Number One Grandpa.'"
Seth Meyers,"And look, I know even if that guy loses 99.9 percent of his wealth he’ll still be richer than me. And I appreciate that he is trying to do that. But does he have to be so tragically lame. If I had as much money as this guy, I’d spend it doing awesome sh*t like buying a sports team or a super-yacht or new vintage Nintendo that I didn’t have to blow on all the time. Yeah kids, we used to blow on our video games, f**k you!” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Sounds like a sick Wookie. You’ve got to be careful. RFK Jr. was there, dude, and if he hears that scream he’s gonna think you’re a dying bear cub and throw you in the back of his weird van."
Seth Meyers,I think Tucker’s just jealous of Kamala because he’s whiter than a polar bear watching Frasier on a sailboat eating a tub of mayo.
Seth Meyers,"By the way, even if she doesn’t get 85 million votes, you’re still a freak. Even if Trump wins it wouldn’t magically erase the fact that you called Trump an angry dad who’s gonna spank his enemies and tell them they’ve been a bad girl and that you once told the entire world you wanted to have sex with a piece of candy. Trump could win by 400 electoral votes next week but the longest section on Tucker’s Wikipedia will still be called ‘Allegations of candy f**king.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"He’s the human equivalent of that groggy feeling you get when you drink too much too fast at brunch and you go home and pass out on the couch and then you wake up a few hours later and it’s dark outside and you don’t know what time it is and your roommate flips on the lights and you say, [clip of Trump at a rally screaming] ‘No, get those lights off! Off!'"
Seth Meyers,"the enemy within”] “If that isn’t fascism, what is. I mean what do you have to do to get branded a fascist by the GOP? I don’t know, get caught praising Hitler? Oh sh*t, right."
Seth Meyers,"Hey MAGA fans, putting aside the rhetoric and just on a pure entertainment level, this is what you waited hours to see? The world’s most tired criminal, a sundowning Frankenstein sleepily burping out fascist threats about ending democracy and an aging wrestler trying to rip off his shirt like a dog trying to get out of his surgery cone?"
Seth Meyers,"Look, I want to give Eric a little wiggle room here. Because I’ve got to imagine when Donald Trump is your dad, your early years are a real Sahara Desert in the hugs department."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know, I warned him not to wear the Beefy T but nobody listens."
Jimmy Kimmel,You know you’re getting old when you lose a wrestling match to your tank top.
Jimmy Kimmel,To me there’s nothing more beautiful than watching a man and his wife try not to smudge each other’s bronzing cream.
Jimmy Kimmel,She greets him like he made a delivery to her art gallery.
Jimmy Kimmel,It was as if they caught her in a glue trap at Saks Fifth Avenue and dragged her there.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Aw, God bless the NDA."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It was ugly, it was mean, it was hateful, it was racist, it was anti-Semitic, it was stupid. They really pissed off Puerto Ricans to the point that bad Bunny had to get involved. And that’s when you know you’ve got a problem."
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump made such a mess with Puerto Ricans that they’re now throwing paper towels at him.
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know he’s just so likable, that’s the thing. And so lifelike. You’d never know he’s made of discarded vibrator parts."
Jimmy Kimmel,a demonic force” and “a destroyer
Jimmy Kimmel,"Don’t worry, as far as God goes I think you’re going to be seeing him pretty soon."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The choice of song, ‘All I Do Is Win Win Win,’ she represented him in court, he lost. He had to pay 83 million dollars. She wins cases the same way he wins elections—not."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Agreed, so then let’s not elect one for President, okay? He does realize he’s endorsing Donald Trump, right? From The Celebrity — The Celebrity Apprentice ."
Jimmy Kimmel,All the stars of the Turd Reich were there.
Jimmy Kimmel,It was like when all the villains team up to poison Gotham City’s water supply.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Oh no. I guess I’d better get a letter from my wealthy father’s podiatrist saying I have bone spurs again. You’d think a guy who dodged the draft would avoid ever saying the word draft in public. You’d think he’d be like, ‘Would you close the window? There’s a dr—a breeze in here.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"It was nice to see people united, especially because we are one week away from finding out which members of our family won’t be invited to Thanksgiving dinner."
Unknown,"Melania Trump made a rare appearance in compliance with section 3, subsection 2/7 of her prenuptial agreement."
Unknown,"Look Jon, I know you’re exhausted. Hell, I’m exhausted. Everyone’s exhausted. Anger and disappointment in our political discourse is exhausting. But it’s easy to throw up our hands and be like, ‘Fine, f**k it. I’m tired. Go ahead and take people’s rights, I’m just gonna plow through a case of Trulys and binge 52 episodes of Love Island .’ Oh you wanna know what those are? Truly’s a hard seltzer and Love Island is like Gilligan’s Island with f**king. I just wanna be clear, okay? Do not let them exhaust you. Don’t let the constant, draining bullsh*t wear you out. Do not turn away. Look it right down that barrel and say, ‘Not today apathy. I’m only having half a case of Trulys and no matter what happens, we have to throw our arms around the people who need us the most and hang the f**k on.'” jessica williams"
Jon Stewart,‘Extremely vile so-called jokes?’ She name-checked my comedy album from the 90’s.
Jon Stewart,I will never not be charmed by his girlish laugh.
Jon Stewart,"Now that’s a lineup that you usually see outside of Madison Square Garden, yelling at strangers as they try to get inside Madison Square Garden."
Jon Stewart,"day one”] “Day one? Have a snack, meet the staff. Day one is generally we just read the syllabus. There’s no homework."
Jon Stewart,"Who the f**k told Donald Trump about the Alien Enemies Act of 1798? ‘Cause I’m gonna bet you something, he did not come to the meeting and go, ‘Hey, why don’t we use the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, would that apply?'"
Jon Stewart,It wouldn’t be the worst thing
Jon Stewart,"You’re right, why hold former Presidents to what they say they’re going to do from their mouth-holes?"
Jon Stewart,"Aw, that makes sense. We’re only deporting people who’ve come here illegally. Or people who have come here legally, but sneaky-legally. Or people who have children who are actually citizens. Or some people who look like they may have come here illegally. Or people that have protested the war in Gaza. Or a special prosecutor Trump doesn’t like, like Jack Smith. Which by the way, name a more American name than Jack f**king Smith. Where are you gonna deport him to Faneuil Hall in Boston?” jon stewart"
Jon Stewart,"Or maybe we’re just going to be deporting the people that always ‘bring wretchedness and want.’ Oh I’m sorry, that’s how we described the Irish in 1832. Or maybe we’re just going to deport people whose race has ‘a certain kind of criminality.’ Oh, I’m sorry, that was the Italians in 1911. The point is, every one of these groups was at a place and time on the wrong side of not being American enough. And right now you think you’re safe because the groups Trump is talking about, it’s not you. As if, ‘Are you sure this isn’t my wife?’ Donald Trump can tell the f**king difference or even cares. That the day one implication of the 1798 law that was last used to intern Japanese and German citizens in World War II will be a fine-toothed comb.” jon stewart"
Jimmy Fallon,Rudy Giuliani wasn’t actually invited. Ever since he lost his apartment he just lives at Madison Square Garden.
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump’s rally was described and unhinged, crude, and racist. As opposed to the stable, polite, and tolerant Trump rallies we’re accustomed to."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump heard as was like, You could have just said ‘on-brand.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Election Day is just a week away and a new report found that Americans are changing their vacation plans due to election anxiety. Yup, people are waiting until after the election so they know whether they’re buying a round-trip or a one-way."
Jimmy Fallon,"A famous British dairy company was just robbed of more than 24 tons of artisanal cheese. The suspects are considered to be armed, dangerous, and a little precious about their mustache."
