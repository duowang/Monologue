Stephen Colbert,Today Trump stood up like a man and took responsibility for absolutely nothing.
Stephen Colbert,"Here’a little pro tip. When you’re running for President, try not to October Surprise yourself."
Stephen Colbert,"It’s rare to tell a joke so bad that it alters the course of human history. The last time that happened, it was 1914 when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was at an open mic. ‘Serbian assassins are so ugly, their portraits hang themselves! Haha, that joke killed…me! Ih oh! World War I is starting!'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Look, someone plans those things, not me. I don’t see or hear anything because they keep me hooded all day long like a falcon, okay.'"
Stephen Colbert,"See Puerto Ricans, you love Trump. And he proved it by sharing this song made by a Cuban band. Okay to be fair, he might not realize those aren’t the same place. ‘Look, I wanna apologize to Puerto Ricans in your native tongue, ‘Lucy, you got a lot of ‘splaining to do!'"
Stephen Colbert,"a love fest”] “Yes it was breathtaking. It was such an evening full of love. It reminds me of the Shakespeare sonnet, ‘Shall I compare thee to a floating pile of garbage?'"
Stephen Colbert,The polls remain incredibly tight as Americans try to decide between an expanded child tax credit and the thousand-year reich of Hamburger Himmler.
Stephen Colbert,"Hitler” out loud] “Well that’s just weird. You can’t say Hitler? What does that mean? It’s not a swear word. ‘My dad used to say you can’t say Hitler, okay. Don’t you dare take his name in vain. He would make me—anytime I would, he would make me put a quarter in the Hitler jar. And when it got filled, he would send it to my uncles in Argentina.'"
Ronny Chieng,"comedian”‘s Puerto Rico material] “Wow, this woman was leaning towards Trump and now she’s voting Kamala because of that one joke. I mean, she was like, ‘I don’t mind racism but I draw the line at racism.'"
Ronny Chieng,"This joke somehow broke through the noise. And as a master political satirist myself, I’m completely jealous. Because all we do here is jokes all the time and it changes nothing! What was the difference maker here, the target? Okay then tell me which countries to sh*t on, I’ll do it. Okay, Australia—you’re the garbage island. Anything? Anyone? Did that move the needle? How is our engagements."
Ronny Chieng,"It’s still crazy to me that a joke from Trump’s warm-up guy seems to be having more of an impact than Trump’s actual terrible record on Puerto Rico. I mean, his administration blocked Puerto Rico from receiving hurricane relief, then Trump went down there and tossed paper towels into the crowd, I guess to help them soak up the hurricane? And to top it all off, Trump tried to trade Puerto Rico for Greenland . I mean, he would rather have a frozen wasteland than a tropical paradise full of brown people with good music.” ronny chieng"
Ronny Chieng,What a f**king stupid idea. No one in Greenland can play shortstop.
Ronny Chieng,Now people are comparing the rhetoric at the MSG rally to another MSG rally in 1939 that involved—you guessed it—Nazis. Which is the worst thing to happen at the Garden other than 20 years of the Knicks.
Ronny Chieng,"Big mistake buddy. I’m Malaysian and the Rock is Samoan. Now you’re insulting two of the biggest movie stars on the planet. Get ready for the backlash, baby."
Ronny Chieng,"Of course Trump is not a Nazi, okay. They all famously served in the military."
Ronny Chieng,You shouldn’t call Trump Hitler because someone will go back in time and kill baby Trump? Even by RFK Jr. standards that makes no sense. I mean it sounds like his brain worm got a brain worm.
Ronny Chieng,"And most people would kill baby Hitler, but only RFK Jr. would then drop the baby Hitler in Central Park and make it look like a bike accident."
Ronny Chieng,"By the way, this is an interesting debate because Kamala has actually never called Trump Hitler. J.D. Vance has though . And if he’s got a time machine, maybe he should go back in time and tell himself to shut the f**k up."
Ronny Chieng,"Yeah, I think they might have other things that they want to talk about first. Like, I don’t know, ‘You’re from the future?! Can you tell me the enemy’s exact position and if any of these bullets are going to hit me right now? Also, bitcoin, is that a thing or not?'"
Ronny Chieng,the opposite of a Nazi
Ronny Chieng,"Yeah cool, thanks for finally going on the record five years later, General John Kelly. Anything else you want to warn us about, like a suspicious bag on the subway in 2004?"
Ronny Chieng,"Over 50 million people ave already voted early. These days Election Day is like a white woman’s birthday, you’ve got to celebrate it for a whole f**king month."
Jimmy Fallon,"Today, following his disastrous rally at Madison Square Garden, former President Trump defended the event and called it an absolute love fest. Then Kamala Harris looked at the polls and said, ‘Well I’m certainly loving it.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Here in New York City it’s expected to be 80 degrees on Halloween. If there’s one smell the city doesn’t need it’s damp werewolf.
Jimmy Fallon,There’s nothing kids like better than a fun size tube-squeeze of Snickers.
Jimmy Fallon,"A JetBlue passenger sued the airline over a dangerously cold ice cream sandwich that she claims broke her tooth. Meanwhile every Southwest passenger is like, You’re getting ice cream sandwiches?"
Jimmy Fallon,"A new lawsuit accuses Subway of grossly misleading customers by advertising sandwiches with three times more meat than it delivers. The CEO of Subway way like, ‘Trust me, we’re doin’ you a favor.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"New York State just banned the sale of caffeine-infused cannabis. Now if you want drugs in your caffeine you have to do it the old way, winking at the Dunkin’ Donuts cashier."
Jimmy Fallon,"We all know it’s a stressful time when adults show up at your house on Halloween and are like, ‘Forget candy, got any Xanax?'"
Seth Meyers,"New York Mayor Eric Adams denied claims over the weekend that former President Trump is a fascist and said, ‘We can all dial down the temperature.’ Which serves as a reminder that no matter who wins on November 5, Mayor Adams is going to need a pardon."
Seth Meyers,"In a recent interview, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance declined to call Russian President Vladimir Putin an enemy and instead labeled him as an adversary. Well that makes sense, a lot of people have an adversarial relationship with their boss."
Seth Meyers,McDonald’s announced that its Quarter Pounder was finally back on the menu after health officials ruled out beef as the source of an E. coli outbreak. They’ve also managed to rule out chicken as the source of McNuggets.
Seth Meyers,Officials have announced that Central Park is already experiencing peak fall colors. It’s my favorite time of the year to gaze up at the trees and get blindsided by a German family on rental bikes.
Seth Meyers,"During his speech in New York on Sunday, former President Trump said, ‘There’s no place like Madison Square Garden.’ He’s right, very few NBA arenas could go over 50 years without seeing a championship."
Seth Meyers,Health officials in Wisconsin have issued a warning that pizza purchased at Famous Yeti’s Pizza may have been contaminated with THC. Although if you’re headed to Famous Yeti’s Pizza you’re probably already contaminated with THC.
Seth Meyers,"At a rally over the weekend in Michigan, Vice President Harris accused former President Trump of looking in the mirror all the time. Really? I’d have guessed, never ?"
Seth Meyers,"A church in England mistakenly showed pornography for a few seconds during a singalong for grade-school kids, and right there on the spot, some of the tenors became baritones."
Seth Meyers,"At a campaign event over the weekend in Pittsburgh, President Biden said that Elon Musk was an illegal worker when he first came to the U.S. Come on that’s not fair. He was never a worker."
Jimmy Kimmel,"If someone who works for you—or let’s say it’s your barber—promises to present you with a plan for trimming your hair over and over again for nine years, you’d probably fire that person. You’d probably get a new barber because your hair would be down to your ass."
Jimmy Kimmel,"‘Childcare is childcare,’ you can’t argue with that. He’s like a child who didn’t do his book report."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Public schools are not giving gender surgeries to children, or any surgeries to children. And without the parents’ permission—parents can’t send their kids to school with peanut butter, okay? School won’t let our kids eat nuts, you think they’re okay with cutting them off?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"‘The wind is bullsh*t.’ Honestly, do you know anyone who speaks like that? The people you know who think the wind is bullsh*t are crazy people standing on a street corner yelling at cars."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s completely preoccupied with nonsense. I’d like you to close your eyes now and imagine you’re at the dinner table on a Sunday night. Your grandpa’s there, and grandpa’s had a long day. He started the day off tweeting hate messages to Taylor Swift, he ended it dancing to the Village People for 39 minutes, you ask him to pass the green beans, and grandpa launches into this. [Clip of Trump proposing his thought problem about sharks and electric boat batteries] No, we don’t! We don’t know what you’re talking about. And we don’t know why you’re talking about it.” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump is the exact meeting point between QAnon and QVC. Remember when Ronald Reagan was selling high-tops in the 80’s? No you don’t, because he wasn’t."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Sharing his favorite bible verse is too personal, but did you hear about Arnold Palmer’s big one?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Look, he obviously hasn’t read the Bible. And that’s okay, just say you haven’t read the Bible. If you did, you’d know you’re not supposed to lie about reading the Bible."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Is this what we want from a President? Someone who believes—or pretends to believe—any crackpot story that fits his narrative? Who blames everything on immigrants? Forgetting, I guess, that two of his three wives were immigrants?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"There are only two possible outcomes. It was stolen or I win. Can you imagine if this happened in the World Series? Like if the manager of the Yankees, Aaron Boone, after the game reporter asks him what the team has to do to come back, he’s like, ‘Come back? We don’t have to come back, we’re winning. We won. They cheated. The umpire was born in L.A. and Ohtani’s an illegal immigrant. I’ll see you at the victory parade.’ He would be taken to the hospital. They’d do an MRI on his brain to find out what was wrong.” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"He has no plan to lower grocery prices, or to make us safer, or to protect the border. The only plans he has is to file lawsuits, legal challenges, settle scores, and punish his enemies. That’s all he has planned. He’s gonna pull all the same tricks he planned last time and more. This is not my opinion, this is happening right out in the open. They’re not even trying to keep it secret. The one thing that makes this a democracy more than anything else are free and fair elections, of the people, by the people, and for the people. That’s what it says. He wants to turn it into of me, by me, and for me.” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"He doesn’t believe that the election was rigged in 2020. His own White House staff testified under oath that he knew all along that there was no evidence of fraud. He knows he lost the election. Trump’s own daughter, his golden child Ivanka, one of his closest advisers said there was no evidence of voter fraud. And yet here we are almost four years later and he’s doing it all over again."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Those poor dummies on January 6, they all went to prison because they believed him. And I get that politicians don’t typically tell the truth, they exagg—but this is ridiculous. How can we have an election if the person who loses won’t accept the results? And thinks CBS should have its license revoked for an episode of 60 Minutes he didn’t like? Who sides with Russia over the CIA and sends Covid equipment to Putin at the height of the pandemic when Americans couldn’t even get it. Not to mention the 34 felony convictions. Will he be President from jail? I mean how do you see that working?” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s planning to pardon himself. Nixon must be rolling over in his grave, just punching himself in the face right now for not thinking of that."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Listen, politics in a lot of ways is like sports. You probably just root for the team your dad roots for. Maybe you’ve been a Republican your whole life, that’s your team and it feels wrong not to vote for them. But this time you wouldn’t be alone, you’d have a lot of company. Because hundreds of prominent Republicans including dozens of members of his own administration, generals, senators, his own chief of staff—I mean, Dick f**king Cheney—all believe he is unfit to be President. This has never happened before. And you know who else isn’t voting for him? I’ll tell you who. This guy, Mike Pence. His adoring, subservient Vice President said ‘I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year.’ Who would have ever thunk it? I mean it’s like if milk turned on cookies.” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know I saw a shirt the other day. It said, ‘I support Trump because he pisses off the people who piss me off.’ And it’s funny, and I get it. Sometimes it feels like no one has a sense of humor any more. But is that really all we want for America is to piss each other off?"
