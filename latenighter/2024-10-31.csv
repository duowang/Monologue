Seth Meyers,"Last time I was this excited for something to be over there was still an hour left in Return of the King . And look, I know that’s a completely unnecessary side-burn on an Oscar winning Lord of the Rings movie that came out 21 years ago, but just let me have this, okay? I’m stressed and I’m on edge and I can’t take out my anger on anyone, so I’m gonna take it out on the hobbits. Because, guys, I already voted and that didn’t help, so I keep scrolling for new polls every day and every day they just say the same f**king thing—’Tied, tied, and, ooh, she’s only down 5 in Texas! No! Get that out of your head! Tied, tied.’ Then finally it seems like the MSG rally’s breaking through and maybe that will tip the scales and then Joe Biden opens his mouth and causes a kerfuffle, and the White House puts out a transcript to correct the record and we all have to decipher it like we’re reading hieroglyphics though a jeweler’s loupe. And we don’t know what he said and we don’t know who’s gonna win and we don’t know if democracy will survive or if a man too dumb to close an umbrella will once again be in charge of the nation’s nuclear arsenal and the only thing we can know for sure is that The Return of the King had too many endings!” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"This has been ‘Seth Loses It Because His Therapist Was on Vacation This Week.’ Hope the leaf-peeping was a success, Dave!"
Seth Meyers,"That’s your closing argument? Aren’t you supposed to be the America First candidate? ‘We love America, don’t we folks, it’s a garbage can. Not one of those nice simplehuman garbage cans from Bed Bath and Beyond, it’s the kind of garbage can that hobos light on fire and stand around. The kind with the little metal handles that you can barely fit through.'"
Seth Meyers,"There’s no defense that those were jokes. Those weren’t jokes, they were beliefs. And Donald Trump has said not one word about them because that’s what he believes too, and that is deeply vile."
Seth Meyers,"The amount this man won’t take responsibility for anything with his name on it is almost impressive. Like President Truman said, ‘The buck stops here.’ Trump is like, ‘I never saw that buck, I never met that buck. And even when you show him a picture of him with the buck he says, I go to a lot of stag parties.'"
Seth Meyers,"That’s not fair, by the way, we photoshopped, obviously in that deer. Here’s the original picture. [Reveal that it’s actually a photo of Trump and deceased Trump wingman and pedophile sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein] I thought it was fair to show you the original picture."
Seth Meyers,"bussing them in”] “My dude, look at the shots from your Atlanta rally and look at her speech in D.C. I guess the bus doesn’t stop in Atlanta?"
Seth Meyers,"But of course Donald Trump wants this campaign to keep going, this is the part he likes. Everyone else is miserable but he’s having the time of his life. I have no doubt that if we could appoint him to a completely powerless position called Campaigner in Chief and let him just go state to state sleepily rambling to half-filled basketball arenas about Hannibal Lecter and toilets that don’t flush and windmills killing birds, our long national nightmare would be over.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Because once the campaign ends, Donald Trump’s life becomes miserable again. You know, either he actually becomes President, a job he hates and is terrible at, or he has to go back to falling asleep in courtrooms and facing the prospect of jail time while sketch artists draw the most unflattering portraits of him that have ever been drawn."
Seth Meyers,"I don’t blame them. There is nothing I would wait three hours to see. One time I took my kids to the mall to take pictures with Santa and the sign said wait time 90 minutes and I just turned to them and said, ‘Santa’s not real.'"
Seth Meyers,"I love how Rogan starts, ‘I’m not gonna cut you off,’ and then 10 seconds later, he’s like, ‘I’m gonna have to cut this f**ker off.'"
Seth Meyers,"‘Are you ever going to present this, ever,’ is a great question, especially when Trump lost roughly 60 court cases challenging the legitimacy of the election. No one who has evidence to support their case chooses not to present it. There’s no legal strategy called rope-a-dope, where you lose the first 60 and then right when they relax, pow!"
Seth Meyers,"[On Trump babbling that he has “papers” all ready to prove the thing he’s been lying about for four years] “60 cases and you never brought in the papers? ‘So many papers, all different shapes and sizes. We had little note cards, giant posters, and photo paper, copy paper, tissue paper, construction paper. Which is great because it comes in different colors but Joe, Joe, you have to be careful with the black paper because if you write with black crayon you can’t see anything and that’s what happened with my evidence of voter fraud.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"My man, go for it. Follow your dreams. Follow that dream. Because if you would drop out, I would make that trade right now. I always say that Dr. Melfi and Tony Soprano was the best therapy ever on TV but if Trump was sitting across from a beluga whale on a couch, I would watch the sh*t out of that."
Jimmy Fallon,Yeah everyone is stressed about the election. Over the weekend I went to a fall festival and bobbed for Xanax in a bottle of Pepto.
Jimmy Fallon,The election is taking over everything. Even Halloween. Tomorrow if you see someone wearing a bunch of eyeliner it’s either Jack Sparrow of sexy J.D. Vance.
Jimmy Fallon,Former President Trump and his team are already making unfounded election fraud claims in Pennsylvania. Trump’s election fraud claims are like the holidays. Every year it feels like they happen earlier and earlier.
Jimmy Kimmel,At times like this it’s important to realize that cannabis is legal in our state.
Jimmy Kimmel,"If you can vote early, vote early. If you can’t vote early, vote on time. If you wanna vote for Trump, vote late, vote very late.” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,This will be my third time voting against Donald Trump. Fifth if you count the two times he was nominated for an Emmy for reality show host.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I don’t blame them, it’s not a smart thing to say. Joe Biden should drop out of this race immediately."
Jimmy Kimmel,Oh my stars. What kind of language is that to use? He’s like an excited little Minion bringing big news to Gru.
Jimmy Kimmel,he has spent his entire career sticking it to the little guy
Jimmy Kimmel,He’s driving a garbage truck. He went out and rented a garbage truck and put his name on the side. Shouldn’t they have put him in the back of that?
Jimmy Kimmel,Kamala must have hired a lot of buses because there were 75 thousand ‘nobodies’ at her rally last night. It’s the most crowded bus stop that I’ve ever seen.
Jimmy Kimmel,"75 thousand is 22 thousand more than showed up for Trump’s rally on that same spot on January 6. And the craziest part is, when she was done speaking, they all just went home."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know, when you find yourself having to tell people ‘I’m not Hitler,’ something is wrong."
Jimmy Kimmel,They call that the Staten Island handshake. Mookie vs. the mooks.
Jimmy Kimmel,"They’ve identified the guy. His name is Austin Capobianco. He’s a neurosurgical oncologist—no , he sells restaurant supplies."
Ronny Chieng,"That’s right. In the last week of the campaign, Republicans are calling for a round-up of immigrants and Democrats are like, ‘You have to put the apostrophe in the right place.'"
Ronny Chieng,This election is really coming down to Nazis and grammar Nazis.
Ronny Chieng,"If Democrats are relying on Americans to know how apostrophes work, then this election is f**ked. Because have you ever seen a sign outside a bar? I mean, they basically use an apostrophe to mean, ‘Here comes an S.'"
Ronny Chieng,"linking arms” message with Trump’s constant finger-pointing] “Yeah, F**k you, fingers, it’s arm time."
Ronny Chieng,"RFK Jr. is actually pretty healthy. I mean, he’s 70 years old, and that’s like 850 in Kennedy years."
Ronny Chieng,How is this guy gonna be in charge of food quality. I mean they found a dead worm in his brain. So even his skull can’t get a higher rating than a C.
Ronny Chieng,"Of all the characters in this election, this guy is the scariest. Because he doesn’t believe in vaccines or pasteurizing milk, he thinks that antidepressants cause school shootings and that Covid was engineered to not affect Jews, and he thinks chemicals in the water make kids trans. And Trump is gonna put him in charge of all the health and food and medicine. I mean at least Trump will put some limits on what he’s gonna do, right? I mean, Donald, you’re not gonna let this guy go wild are you? [Clip of Trump claiming, ‘I’m gonna let him go wild on health’] Wait, how are you gonna let him go wild on medicine? Like, are you gonna let him dip his balls in the cough syrup?” ronny chieng"
Stephen Colbert,"But the big story of this election is Kamala Harris going down to Washington last night where she delivered a speech specifically designed to purple Trump’s nurple. ‘Cause Harris gave it at The Ellipse, the same place Donald Trump held his ‘let’s go beat up some cops’ rally on January 6."
Stephen Colbert,"YMCA”] “‘Nuh-uh, that is my song. Now the Democrats have it and you know they’re gonna turn it into some kind of gay anthem.'"
Stephen Colbert,"I cannot emphasize this enough, do not trick-or-treat at Elon’s house."
Stephen Colbert,The news may affect the race because Musk is one of Trump largest donors—of money.
Stephen Colbert,"Elon, I’m not sure women would agree that the reason behind declining birth rates is, ‘There’s just not enough sperm out there.'"
Stephen Colbert,"So a warning to Elon’s friends and acquaintances, that’s not sourdough starter."
Stephen Colbert,And you know a story is always gonna end well when it starts with ‘a compound in Texas.'
Stephen Colbert,"A for effort”] “Yeah, A for effort. Also A for a-hole."
Stephen Colbert,"Jaywalking has been legalized in New York City. To which New Yorkers were like, ‘Wait, jaywalking was illegal? But it’s still okay to shave my legs in the space between the moving subway cars, right?'"
Stephen Colbert,"As one city council member said, ‘Let’s be real, every New Yorker jaywalks.’ Yeah, that’s why the crosswalk signal options in this city are walking man and ‘Munch my balls, Citibike!'"
