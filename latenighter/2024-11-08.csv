name,monologue
Seth Meyers,"You know not everything the Democrats did the last four years was great but one thing you can’t complain about was the deliberate pace with which Merrick Garland prosecuted Donald Trump. I mean he dotted his ‘I’s and crossed his ‘T’s and crossed his ‘I’s, then he crossed out his ‘I’s and replaced them with ‘T’s, then he crossed his actual eyes and put dots on his t-shirt."
Seth Meyers,"[On the probable dismissal of Trump’s criminal cases] “And do you know what, you’ll probably get your way because the Supreme Court gave Trump immunity and the DOJ has a dumb policy about not prosecuting sitting presidents, and it stinks. We have a stupid system which basically makes getting elected president a get out of jail free card. They’re gonna have to add one to Monopoly that says, ‘Run for president, collect $200.’ And then a second card that says, ‘Unless you’re Rudy Giuliani, then you’re still broke and disbarred and weird.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"And sure, at the end of four years there’s literally nothing to show for it. But is that what a Justice Department is even for, results? Or is it all about… the journey?"
Seth Meyers,"Pretty awesome that by winning the presidency, you get off scot free from your many legal cases. Justice is served. Republican defenders are gonna start giving this advice to clients who get busted selling weed. ‘Okay Dougie, I know you’re facing six months in county lockup so you can either fight the charges or, hear me out, run for president.’ ‘Awww, they’re never gonna like me, man. I once pretended to give a BJ to a microphone.’ ‘Would you believe that is no longer a problem?'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"You think Kamala Harris was too far left? She was campaigning with Liz Cheney. The only way she could have run a more mainstream, centrist campaign is if she would have formed a Huey Lewis cover band with Mitt Romney and did a cameo on Law & Order ."
Seth Meyers,"So conservatives are taking joy from liberal sadness but, hey, it’s not all bad. Some people are doing great after Trump’s victory. You know, like the small town farmers and factory workers he promised to help—and I’m just f**king with you, it’s rich dudes."
Stephen Colbert,"So after years of investigation into Trump’s many crimes, including trying to overthrow the U.S. government, everything’s just totally cool. It reminds me of that classic song, ‘I Fought the Law and What? I Won? How Is That Even Possible?'"
Stephen Colbert,"We still don’t know the entire parade of clowns, degenerates, and in-laws that Trump will have running this country. But one guy we know will have a major role is RFK Jr. Now if you’re not familiar with him it’s probably because he ran for president and nobody cared."
Stephen Colbert,"Now that sounds deranged, but he actually has a good reason for all of this—a worm got into his brain and ate a portion of it and then died. So naturally this whale-decapitating, bear-dumping, walking talking worm cemetery is who Donald Trump wants to put in charge of our nation’s health."
Stephen Colbert,go wild on medicine”] “Oh good. Because that’s exactly how I like my medicine. Wild. It’s just like the directions on the pill bottle say: Go crazy balls every 2-4 hours with food.
Stephen Colbert,"Now I’m not the smartest guy in the room. There are no worms lining up to eat portions of my brain. But I went to the Kellogg’s Canada website and it turns out Canadian Fruit Loops actually have 26 ingredients. And that doesn’t even count the gravy, which Canadians use to make fruit-ine."
Stephen Colbert,No one knows how this happened. But one theory is that the facility was researching how quickly you could lose 43 monkeys.
Stephen Colbert,"The lab, owned by the completely benign-sounding Alpha Genesis corporation, is located on South Carolina’s Morgan Island, known as Monkey Island. Or as it will soon be called—Island."
Stephen Colbert,"Adding, ‘But please keep your doorbell camera on. ‘Cause what if they start humping your old jack o’lantern? That would be hilarious.'"
Stephen Colbert,"What? But if there are no more TGIFridays, what are we going to thank God for now? I don’t understand, Wednesday? We’re too busy humping! God doesn’t want to see that."
Stephen Colbert,So the greatest threat TGIFridays is facing is that someday it might occur to people to dine there.
Stephen Colbert,"Now since you’re newbies I’m gonna give you a little bit of advice. You’re gonna see a bunch of pop-up ads for single MILFs in your area. But just know, they are totally real. In fact most of the MILFs are hiding in Ukrainian tanks and, if you want a glimpse, you just have to look down that really long peephole on the front of the tank and then knock on the armor and say, ‘Give it to me!'"
Stephen Colbert,Making this the first time a U.S. intelligence agency has been thwarted by incognito mode.
Stephen Colbert,"‘You listen up mister. If you don’t stop making these sex tapes, we will install more cameras from every angle! And if that doesn’t work, we’re gonna fill your desk with so much lube.'"
Ronny Chieng,Apparently you can get away with your crimes if you win the presidency. And that sound you just heard is Diddy forming an exploratory committee for 2028.
Ronny Chieng,"Woww, peaceful transfer of power. Let’s hear it for the bare minimum of a democracy."
Ronny Chieng,"Yes, Kamala called Trump, conceded the race, and told him there should be a peaceful transfer of power. And you know as soon as Trump hung up the phone, he was like, ‘Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s great. F**kin’ pussies.'"
Ronny Chieng,So I guess American democracy still works—as long as the guy who likes overthrowing the government wins the election because then he won’t overthrow the government.
Ronny Chieng,"Oh my God, we get it, okay? You people f**king love transferring power peacefully. Just on and on about it. Hey, maybe if Democrats tried an insurrection once in a while, they could actually start winning something."
Ronny Chieng,"So with the transfer of power happening, we’re going to be talking about Donald Trump. I for one did not think when I came out of the jungles of Malaysia to do comedy that I would be making jokes about Donald Trump every day for 13 years straight. 13 years! I don’t talk about anybody as much as I—I don’t talk about my mom as much as I talk about this guy. I don’t talk about my wife as much as I talk about this guy. My wife thinks I’m having an emotional affair with him.” ronny chieng"
Ronny Chieng,I’m gonna be talking about this guy on my f**king deathbed. Which I assume is gonna be in about three years when he somehow brings back the bubonic plague.
Ronny Chieng,Great. It’s take your dumbass to work day.
Ronny Chieng,who think they know better than the duly elected president
Ronny Chieng,This cabinet looks like the division of the X-Men for the mutants who had too much mutation.
Ronny Chieng,"Okay so this is the A-team. And other names floated for his cabinet include Hannibal Lecter, the Menendez brothers, the polio virus, and for the Secretary of transportation, a Cybertruck with a Hitler mustache."
Jimmy Kimmel,no one is above the law
Jimmy Kimmel,"The President gave a gracious speech. He told the nation, ‘You can’t love your country only when you win.’ Which got a huge laugh in the lunch room at Mar-a-Lago."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know Biden is in a powerful position right now. Thanks to Trump’s buddies on the Supreme Court, the president has immunity from prosecution for official acts. I say take that sucker for a ride. I would confiscate Clarence Thomas’ RV and go for a little POTUS immunity road trip, if you know what I mean."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The crazy thing is, there are still two months before our long national nightmare even begins. It’s like we’re standing in the middle of the road waiting for a bus to hit us but it’s still 40 miles away."
Jimmy Kimmel,At least my children like me.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The guy who paid people a million dollars a day is calling me a propaganda puppet. Listen Kermit, you bought Twitter. You bought a social media platform that is literally a propaganda machine. Let me tell you something, if I spent two weeks trying to come up with a four-word description of Elon Musk, I don’t think I could do better than ‘insufferable nonsense propaganda puppet.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,drop to your knees and beg
Jimmy Kimmel,"Not just on the loose, on the loose from the Alpha Genesis facility, which sounds exactly like what an evil laboratory that unleashes an army of monkeys on a town would be named."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I have to say I’m kind of jealous of these people. I feel like it would be fun to believe everything. Like UFOs, and 5G, chemtrails, aliens built the pyramids, the Illuminati, pizzagate—it’s like living inside a wild South Korean Netflix show."
Jimmy Kimmel,"If you have trouble getting drugs in Florida, you need a faster ATV."
Jimmy Fallon,"During his speech, Biden said, ‘You can’t love your country only when you win.’ Then he said, ‘But since I didn’t win or lose, I can do whatever the hell I want.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Apparently Vladimir Putin has congratulated Trump through their mutual friends. Oh please, just say Elon."
Jimmy Fallon,The first IHOP-Applebees restaurant is opening in Texas. I hope it goes better than the Hardee’s combined with Dunkin Donuts that became Dee’s Nuts.
