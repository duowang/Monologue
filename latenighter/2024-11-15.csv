Jordan Klepper,Happy Thanksgiving? Matt Gaetz has nothing to do with Thanksgiving. Besides him and the turkeys both needing pardons.
Jordan Klepper,"I like this strategy for avoiding the press, though. ‘Sir, do you have regrets about the internment camps?’ ‘Happy Arbor Day!'"
Jordan Klepper,"First of all, I’m not sure Matt Gaetz knows how to brag. You’re going around telling coworkers that you’re freebasing viagra? ‘And you know I had to use an extra small condom bro, yeah! Hit me up top!'"
Jordan Klepper,"Also, who drinks energy drinks? Pound some coffee like an adult sexual predator, man!"
Jordan Klepper,"I don’t get it. Do you hate Matt Gaetz or do you not, Markwayne? You can’t have it both ways. Unlike your mom did when she couldn’t decide whether to name you Mark or Wayne."
Jordan Klepper,"There you have it folks, the Republican submission to Donald Trump in a nutshell. ‘Matt Gaetz forced me to watch his sex tapes, and yes, I will be voting for him. Happy Thanksgiving.'"
Jordan Klepper,the worst cabinet nomination in American history
Jordan Klepper,"Wow, what a crafty legal maneuver by Matt Gaetz. He must be dating a girl who does mock trial."
Jordan Klepper,"And if you’re wondering, Why does Matt Gaetz’s party hate him so much, the answer would actually take some time. It’s not just the underage sex allegation, it’s also that he routinely attacks other Republicans, he doesn’t do any work himself, and his personal quest to overthrow Speaker Kevin McCarthy so divided his party, a fellow Republican had to be restrained by the mouth from fighting him on the House floor. It was the first time in history Congress had to call a face mask penalty.” jordan klepper"
Jordan Klepper,"Clearly the Justice Department is about to get a hardcore bro makeover. I mean once Gaetz is in power, you’re going to get to plead guilty, not guilty, and, ‘The f**k’s your problem, man?'"
Jordan Klepper,Yay! Unpasteurized whale juice for everybody!
Jordan Klepper,"Wow, this is exciting news. We are making things in America again. Specifically, Patient Zeroes."
Seth Meyers,"‘If Donald Trump says jump, we jump. If he says scratch your heads, we scratch our heads. If he says, ‘Do the worm,"
Seth Meyers,"Don’t you guys have any self respect? When you try to pick someone up at a bar, you try to be suave. You don’t walk up to them and say, ‘Hello, did you fall from heaven because you are an angel and I will do anything you ask from me— please where are you going, do you know I can jump and scratch my head at the same time!'"
Seth Meyers,That’s what the next four years are gonna be like. Members of the United States Senate just being shocked on air. You’d get the same reaction if you just made them watch viral videos of dudes jumping into frozen pools.
Seth Meyers,"moderate” GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) complaining that instead of Gaetz, the country needs “a serious Attorney General"
Seth Meyers,"‘Yet.’ I mean, you forgot the word ‘yet.’ Trump’s still got plenty of time to outdo himself. Just wait until he names his Secretary of the Interior, a bear who got stuck in a dumpster."
Seth Meyers,"His own colleagues are saying he crushed E.D. meds and slept with a 17-year-old, like a bunch of woke scolds!"
Seth Meyers,"Even crazier, Gaetz’s girlfriend just got class president."
Seth Meyers,"on her bingo card”] “Also, for everyone who didn’t have that on your bingo card, maybe throw out the bingo card, because it’s a whole new bingo now. Instead of numbers it’s just going to be symbols from the Zodiac Killer."
Seth Meyers,As for what’s on Matt Gaetz’s bingo card: B-17.
Seth Meyers,"So Trump came up with a plan the same way a four-year-old shoves a battery in his nose, because he was unsupervised."
Seth Meyers,He’s just gonna pick people he’s seen on Fox News. There’s a good chance our next Secretary of Transportation’s going to be the guy from the Acorn Lift commercials.
Seth Meyers,"You know how bad an idea has to be for Steve Doocy to push back on it. Doocy’s kind of like the RA of that group. Kind of checked out, trying to be cool, but occasionally he comes by, knocks on your door, and says, ‘Hey guys, I was cool about the weed, but clearly dorm rules say no axes, guys.'"
Seth Meyers,"When you put it like that, it sounds very damning. If you go on a date with someone and they tell you they were recently fired from their job at Subway and you ask why and they say, ‘I was accused of certain things that are under review,’ that’s when you run. Nine times out of 10, that means they stuck their dick between two slices of bread and said, ‘Hey look, five dollar foot-long!'"
Seth Meyers,"That’s our next Secretary of Defense describing the war in Ukraine like a boyfriend that got kicked out of the house. ‘Becky, it’s me Pete, I wan’t my sh*t back! Oh, you’re throwin’ my clothes our the window? Very mature. Hey that’s my axe, don’t throw my axe!'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Troy, you embarrassing yourself. He’s not going to sleep with you, okay?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"There are many theories as to why Trump is naming this battalion of bozos to do these very important jobs. Some believe he’s testing the Republican congress to see how far he can push them. Some say he’s doing this strategically to weaken certain sections of the government. Or, and this is the theory that I believe, he’s dumb."
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump originally wanted a doctor in that role. Turns out the late great Hannibal Lecter isn’t a real person.
Jimmy Kimmel,This tells you all you need to know about our country right now. RFK got caught having phone sex with a reporter and she was fired. What happened to him? They made him Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Jimmy Kimmel,It’s like the worst People’s Choice Awards every day now.
Jimmy Kimmel,You know the fight was originally scheduled for July but it got delayed because Tyson was having medical issues. And it might have to be delayed again if either Mike or Jake Paul get nominated for cabinet positions tomorrow.
Jimmy Kimmel,Can I change my vote?
Stephen Colbert,he just tasted something strange
Stephen Colbert,"exasperated” reaction from Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA)] “Grassley’s 91. Are you sure that was exasperation? ‘Oh look, grandpa’s so exasperated that he closed his eyes and plunged face-first into his soup.'"
Stephen Colbert,"There’s no denying that this is a weird time. But today was not the worst day since Trump was elected. That was yesterday, and maybe tomorrow. And also today."
Stephen Colbert,"So now Gaetz almost certainly will not face consequences. Coincidentally, Face Consequences also the name of his off-brand botox."
Stephen Colbert,"Dear Santa, I have been a very good boy this year and have only one wish. For a comet to hit the Earth and bathe us in the bright cleansing flames… and one of those electric bikes where you don’t have to pedal."
Stephen Colbert,"Okay Senator, that is your first mistake right there. Now that Trump’s been reelected, we all get new bingo cards with none of those boring numbers like B-14 and N-7. Mine has, let’s see, ‘Trump-Putin Matching Track Suits,’ ‘Chief Justice Kid Rock,’ and ‘Deport Ricky Martin.’ Ooh, ‘Ranch Dressing Fountain.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Up ’til now the theory has been that the craziest of the crazies were never gonna get any of the big nominations because they were all going to be kept at bay by Trump’s new Chief of Staff and Golden Girl who murdered all of the other Golden Girls, Susie Wiles."
Stephen Colbert,"So that’s how Trump’s gonna get away with everything. ‘Uh, Susie, the president wants you to know there’s cake in the break room. Okay, quick while she’s gone: the new Surgeon General is Dog the Bounty Hunter.'"
Stephen Colbert,"So it turns out Trump is filling his cabinet with a game of I Spy on his plane. Explains how we got our new Secretary of Agriculture, mini bag of pretzels."
Stephen Colbert,"I know that sounds insane, but we should all keep an open mind. ‘Cause that’s how the worm gets in."
Stephen Colbert,"Besides being a vaccine denier, RFK spread a racist conspiracy that Covid-19 was ethnically targeted to spare Jewish and Chinese people. So good news to everyone of Chinese or Jewish descent who got Covid-19… no you didn’t."
Stephen Colbert,"Bobby Jr. also said chemicals in the water could also be turning children gay. That is insane! That is nonsense—water doesn’t turn a person gay. Although I gotta say, Jason Momoa in Aquaman came pretty darn close."
Stephen Colbert,"Now one of the reasons why Gabbard is such an awful choice for the role is that we can’t be sure which country she’s working for. She’s been a booster for autocrats such as Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. And look, I’m not saying she’s a Russian asset, but when I think of her being director of national intelligence, I do have a strong desire to drink vodka.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,in the spirit of aloha
Jimmy Fallon,"I’m a little worried about this because there’s a 30-year age gap between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson. I mean think of it the other way around, if Mike Tyson was boxing Al Pacino, would we be okay with this?"
Jimmy Fallon,"The fight is on Netflix, so about the fifth round I think we’re going to find out that Mike Tyson is actually made of cake."
Jimmy Fallon,"Melania Trump is unlikely to move into the White House full time for Trump’s second term. When asked when she will be at the White House, Melania said, ‘Whenever my husband is at Mar-a-Lago.'"
