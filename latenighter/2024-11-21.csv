Stephen Colbert,"It’s a day that ends in a Y, which means that Donald Trump has made another cabinet pick that makes you go, ‘Why?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Fun fact, the new Secretary of Education nominee has no teaching background. But you know what they say, ‘Those who can, do. Those who can’t get a job in the Trump administration.'"
Stephen Colbert,That headline again: Dr. Oz has a hot third cousin.
Stephen Colbert,"He’s right, it offers a lot of clues. For example, if you’re sniffin’ people’s pee on television, it’s possible that you freaky."
Stephen Colbert,"Trump also named his new Press Secretary. It’s former campaign press secretary and woman in a Hallmark movie who moved home for Christmas to throw paint at the gay bakery, Karoline Leavitt ."
Stephen Colbert,"‘Okay let’s get started. President Trump has decided to invade Greenland, any questions? Yeah, Hawk Tuah girl. We will get to you next, Mr. The Rizzler.'"
Stephen Colbert,"What the hell is it that they don’t want us to see? Because the stuff we already know is so terrible that if Gaetz ever moves to a new neighborhood he’s gonna have to introduce himself door-to-door. ‘Hi, I’m legally required to let you know that I’m the Attorney General.'"
Stephen Colbert,"So the vote went along strict party lines. And when Geatz heard the words ‘party lines,’ he showed up with a rolled-up hundred dollar bill."
Stephen Colbert,"If Gaetz wants to get confirmed in the Senate, he’s got a lot of work to do. Not on his face, he’s already done too much on that."
Stephen Colbert,"Happy birthday, Joe! we got you a cake [pulls out empty cake stand] but Nancy Pelosi insisted you sacrifice it for the good of democracy."
Stephen Colbert,They’re down to the final four. Which means they’re headed to the fantasy suites. And then we meet the monkeys’ parents.
Desi Lydic,There’s not gonna be a layer of competent workers at some point. It’s just celebrities all the way down.
Desi Lydic,"Donald Trump isn’t really picking leaders of agencies, he’s just picking mascots. But nobody expects Mr. Met to actually pick up a bat and hit a ball. Because, one, he would just be terrible at it. And two, you’re just asking him to hit his children and he can’t do that."
Desi Lydic,"But to be fair, Trump isn’t just filling his cabinet with daytime TV personalities, he’s also hiring from pay-per-view."
Desi Lydic,"Okay, hold on. It could be worse. At least Dr. Oz is an actual doctor. I’m impressed he didn’t pick Dr. Pepper."
Desi Lydic,I hope he was promoting quack science for personal gain. It would be way weirder if he was just doing it for the love of the game.
Desi Lydic,"Listen, if you need a CNN segment to teach you how to make your wife orgasm, don’t worry. She’s been f**king the neighbor for six months."
Desi Lydic,"So far he’s made a number of cabinet picks whose main qualification seems to be being on TV. His Defense Secretary is a guy from Fox & Friends , his Transportation Secretary is a guy from Fox Business, and his Attorney General is a guy who I’m pretty sure was on To Catch a Predator ."
Seth Meyers,"Oh come on Bernie, you’re being ridiculous. You’re acting like billionaires are on stage next to presidential candidates literally jumping for joy and—oh sh*t!"
Seth Meyers,"This clip proves that money can buy you almost anything, but it can’t buy you ups."
Seth Meyers,"What does the former head of a wrestling league know about education. Oh no, are teachers gonna open class now by making sweaty threats into microphones? ‘Oh, you’re in for it now brother. Oooh, you forgot to carry the one and now I’m gonna carry you to your grave!'"
Seth Meyers,"Good point, maybe Musk could do for our government what he did for Twitter. My issue with FEMA has always been the lack of hate speech and porn bots. I’m looking forward to the next disaster alert: ‘If u looking for good time join xxx video call with fun real girls right now. The government has issued a flood warning—in my pants!!!'"
Seth Meyers,He doesn’t? I thought when he did that episode on how to get a flatter stomach I thought he was doing so as the Assistant Undersecretary of State for Washboard Abs.
Seth Meyers,"So now he’s adding Dr. Oz to his cabinet on top of a wrestling executive and a former Real World contestant. Who’s next, is he gonna make Chumlee the Treasury Secretary? [Photo of the Washington Monument] ‘Mr. President, I think we can make at least a thousand bucks if we sell this big old penis statue.'"
Seth Meyers,"Trump nominated two more billionaires to his cabinet while another billionaire, Elon Musk, came to the defense of Trump’s Attorney General nominee Matt Gaetz. Who’s not a billionaire but only because he doesn’t like any number higher than 18."
Seth Meyers,"‘He’s got a big brain, he’s got a spine of steel, and his eyes will be wide open because he can’t close ‘em because of all the botox.'"
Seth Meyers,"Also, if you’re the nation’s top law enforcement officer, you’re not supposed to have an axe to grind. You wouldn’t go to a doctor whose wife left him for you. ‘Oh hello Dave. I hope you’re enjoying sleeping with my wife. Now are you ready for your colonoscopy? Oh just FYI, we’re out of anesthesia!'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Every Republican on the House committee, every member of the law and order, family values party voted against releasing their findings. Just like you’d do with any ethics report that completely exonerates someone."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Releasing the report would require one Republican, only one, to vote with Democratic members of the committee. In other words, in a party full of Minions, we have to hope that one of them is a Stuart."
Jimmy Kimmel,He’s not gonna pick somebody that’s a criminal
Jimmy Kimmel,"At least one witness testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with a 17-year old at a party, and that is not allowed at Chuck E. Cheese at all."
Jimmy Kimmel,"There they are, J.D. and V.D. together."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Poor J.D. Vance. Trump’s off going to rocket launches with Elon Musk, he’s going to UFC. J.D. Vance is stuck chaperoning the world’s creepiest prom king in Washington."
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s right, a man who does not play the guitar is selling limited-edition guitars. There he is, Skeevy Ray Vaughan."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The guy who says we can’t afford apples is selling $10,000 dollar guitars."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Let’s not jump to conclusions, maybe he’s got some Fun Dip in there."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yep, Laura Trump’s new athleisure line is called the LT brand. Not to be confused with Trump’s athleisure line, delululemon."
