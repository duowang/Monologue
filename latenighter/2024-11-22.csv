Seth Meyers,"Matt Gaetz is out? But his nomination was only eight days old! Once again, he can’t even make it to 18."
Seth Meyers,This puts a lot of pressure on Trump because now there’s not a lot of time to find somebody worse.
Seth Meyers,"Oh my God, they asked him for a comment and his comment was, ‘I quit.’ This is like if the Mystery Gang showed up to a haunted amusement park and the first ghost they saw ripped off his mask and said, ‘All right, fine, you got me. It’s Matt Gaetz. Heyyy, and while I’m here, what’s your deal, Daphne?'"
Seth Meyers,"Look at that diagram. It looks like something you’d get back from 23 and Me, except it’s 17 and Me."
Seth Meyers,"Yeah sure, dude. He dropped out because he was doing so well. This is the Jets holding a press conference to say they have plans for Super Bowl weekend. ‘Yeah, we’d love to come but we have a wedding. We can’t miss the wedding.'"
Seth Meyers,"Gaetz was not doing very well. He was doing the worst of all your cabinet picks, and that’s saying a lot. One of them dumped a bear carcass in Central Park and was investigated for cutting the head off a whale with a chainsaw. Another bragged in her memoir about murdering a dog, and the first guy was like, You gonna keep the body? Dead dog—I’d love to call dibs on the dead dog! And another, your nominee for Secretary of Defense, participated in a lumberjack battle on Fox News where he threw an axe on live TV and totally missed the target. Only Trump could see that and think, ‘He should be in charge of the military.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"It’s just that Gaetz was so egregious, no one had time for anything else. That’s the Trump playbook, just flood the zone with terrible choices so we don’t have the capacity to react to all of them. It’s like being the only security guard at a Best Buy on Black Friday whose bosses say, ‘Don’t let anybody get out of control, Dave.'"
Seth Meyers,"As part of their department of government effiiciency efforts, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy said yesterday they’re considering requiring federal employees to return to work in the office full time. Though if you want people to get up early, put on pants, and drive an hour to an office, I don’t think you know what efficiency means.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"If anything, Gaetz dropping out should pave the way to focus on the other dangerous nominees. Like axe-man Pete Hegseth, who was also accused of sexual assault and who was flagged as a possible insider threat by a fellow service member. Or Dr. Oz, his nominee to run Medicare and Medicaid, who pushed quack treatments on TV and who owns stock in pharmaceutical companies. And of course RFK Jr., the world’s most famous hotel for brain worms, who has such a checkered past, he said this about himself at a campaign event. [Clip of Kennedy claiming, ‘I’ve got so many skeletons in my closet that if they could vote I’d be king of the world’] In fairness, they’re only skeletons because they refused to get vaccinated for measles.” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley yesterday criticized president-elect Trump for selecting former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence and accused her of sympathizing with America’s adversaries. Well wait ’til she finds out who we elected president.
Seth Meyers,Kraft Mac & Cheese is offering a limited edition everything bagel flavor that will be sold exclusively at Walmart. Though you’re a stronger person than me if you can go into a Walmart that stoned.
Seth Meyers,"The FBI launched an investigation yesterday into the recent burglaries of the homes of Kansas City Chiefs quarterbakc Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce. ‘But how else are we supposed to get a ring?,’ said the Jaguars."
Desi Lydic,So pour out a Capri Sun for one of the GOATs.
Desi Lydic,"What a week Gaetz has had. He resigned from Congress, everyone talked non-stop about how he’s a sex criminal and a pedophile, and now he doesn’t even get to be Attorney General. This guy is f**ked so hard that he had to Venmo himself ten grand."
Desi Lydic,"Yes, of course, you just want to protect women from hypothetical predators. That would play a lot better if you weren’t trying to get actual predators into the highest levels of government. Pete Hegseth, RFK, Matt Gaetz. If Donald Trump nominated Bill Cosby, Nancy Mace would be walking in circles in an ugly ’80’s sweater eating a pudding pop."
Desi Lydic,"Oh, you want to watch all the great things Matt Gaetz will do? May I suggest you download the Citizen app ."
Desi Lydic,"Hmm, okay, forget about the economy. I guess the national mandate was making it harder for this one woman to poop at work."
Desi Lydic,"Obviously, transphobic Cruella deVil’s logic might backfire here because all of her drama ironically is affirming Sarah McBride’s gender. There is nothing that defines the female experience more than starting a new job and a woman at work just decides she hates you."
Desi Lydic,What the f**k? 325 tweets? How can anyone else even use the bathroom when Mace is on the toilet tweeting all day?
Desi Lydic,I have never hated anything so much that I had to buy a new data plan.
Desi Lydic,"Even Elon Musk was like, ‘Have you considered BlueSky?'"
Desi Lydic,"Hmm, wonder what changed? I guess the biggest transition was Nancy Mace wanting to identify as the center of attention."
Jimmy Kimmel,Gaetz said he was honored that Trump nominated him and he looks forward to spending more time posing as a high school senior on the Roblox Reddit page.
Jimmy Kimmel,The last time Trump made this many calls on behalf of an unqualified candidate was to get his son Eric into Georgetown.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Poor Rudy Giuliani. He has to be on the twin bed in the office his son converted into a guest room right now going, ‘What about me?'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"This Gaetz situation is a setback for Trump but it’ll all be forgotten as soon as he nominates new Surgeon General, Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable."
Jimmy Kimmel,Donald Trump is determined to fill his cabinet with not just clowns—demented sewer clowns. Stephen King clowns.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He said he did this as a satirical jab at market speculation. And it worked. I mean this whole time people have been investing in Apple, they should have been investing in banana."
Jimmy Kimmel,Justin says he looks forward to eating the banana in the coming days. He’s gonna slice it up and have it on his morning Picasso.
Stephen Colbert,"An air hockey table? Who was this sexual encounter with, Dave and Buster?"
Stephen Colbert,That sounds cooling and refreshing. Way better than doing it on the Whac-A-Mole.
Stephen Colbert,Why on Earth are you watching? ‘Hold on [pulls quarter out of pocket] I got winner.'
Stephen Colbert,This chart connects all the characters in the Matt Gaetz Skinematic Universe.
Stephen Colbert,distraction”] “That is true. All of the attention on this sex criminal was totally distracting from the work of all the other sex criminals who’ve been nominated. And elected.
Stephen Colbert,"Only 3 in 10 Americans have favorable views of Pete Hegseth, Matt Gaetz, and Kristi Noem. Meaning they poll slightly below that thing where you bite the inside of your cheek and it forms a lump so you keep biting it all day by accident."
Stephen Colbert,"Now if you purchase one of these guitars, you are divorced. And if you say, ‘Actually Steve, I’m not divorced,’ well, go tell your spouse you just blew ten grand on a Trump guitar then call me back."
Stephen Colbert,Aw hell yeah ! It’s like if the side of your cousin’s van could play music.
Stephen Colbert,You go girl! She broke that glass ceiling and then she popped… because she is a balloon.
Jimmy Fallon,So far Trump hasn’t named a replacement but right now Rudy Giuliani is outside throwing pebbles at his bedroom window.
Jimmy Fallon,"A crypto entrepreneur just bought an art piece of a duct-taped banana for over 6 million dollars. I mean, I know it sounds like a waste of money…"
Jimmy Fallon,"Sure that’s okay, but when I go to see Conclave dressed as the pope, I’m being weird."
Jimmy Fallon,A plane in Portugal was grounded for four days after 132 hamsters escaped from the cargo load. Originally it was just two hamsters but they were on their honeymoon.
