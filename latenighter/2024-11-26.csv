Seth Meyers,"You know, my goal these days is to stay in a good mood about things. And nothing’s making me feel better than the fact that Donald Trump finally got his own Donald Trump."
Seth Meyers,"But the lesson here is, if you leave Trump unsupervised for a second he’ll do something insane. That should work out great with a president who will be 82 by the end of his term. ‘I want to do a rocket launch to show up Elon.’ ‘Sir, that’s a nuclear missile silo. That would trigger WWIII and end life on Earth as we know it.’ ‘Okay, could you go get me a Diet Coke… aaand, they’re gone. Aim at Elon’s house.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Man, I almost forgot how fun it is when the leader of the free world is easily excitable and easily distracted. You know, it’s either that or four straight years of constantly refreshing while Trump’s brain says it’s buffering."
Seth Meyers,"It hasn’t even been three weeks since the election, they’re already descending into name-calling and shouting. That’s what the Democrats are supposed to be doing. Stop stealing their moves."
Seth Meyers,I can’t believe what the White House is going to be like when they actually take over and have real responsibilities. Everybody’s going to be throwing chairs and dodging fists while Trump tries to sneak out with his golf clubs like an elderly Ray Romano.
Seth Meyers,"The words ‘a liberated Donald Trump’ are not reassuring. They’re terrifying—it’s like a video message from an eco-terrorist saying, ‘We have liberated the infected monkeys. And now they run amongst you!'"
Seth Meyers,"Power is supposed to be constrained, not liberated. The fact that Donald Trump felt hemmed in during his first term was a good thing. Regardless of party, the most powerful person in the world should feel some constraints. I would also have been concerned if Barack Obama held a press conference after he won reelection and said, ‘Well, I have been liberated. Sooo, watch out motherf**kers.'"
Seth Meyers,"President Biden today presided over the annual White House turkey pardon. Well, he didn’t exactly pardon them. He just turned the investigation over to Merrick Garland and then it just kind of petered out."
Seth Meyers,"That’s right, President Biden presided over the annual White House turkey pardon, and granted clemency to Peach, Blossom, and, before anyone noticed, Hunter."
Seth Meyers,"Wow, not only did he lose the AG job and his congressional seat, they downgraded his internet plan."
Seth Meyers,"Before this, the only way to get a video message from Matt Gaetz was unsolicited."
Seth Meyers,"Well that explains the shouting matches at Mar-a-Lago. They’re chugging Monster Energy and chewing on Cialis like they’re Life Savers. ‘We should do tariffs first!’ ‘We should do tax cuts first!’ ‘You get the hell out of here!’ ‘You get the hell out of here!’ ‘Are you rock hard right now?’ ‘You know I am, dog!'"
Seth Meyers,"President-elect Trump has announced Pam Bondi as his Attorney general. Bondi will leave her current job, following you around Talbot’s with her phone out."
Seth Meyers,"President-elect Trump’s transition team is facing criticism for not disclosing the donors who are funding its operations. Okay, but I think we know. You think Trump is spending his time with Elon Musk because he’s a fun hang?” seth meyers"
Jimmy Fallon,A record 80 million Americans are traveling for the holiday. But don’t worry because today the TSA announced that they’re opening a second lane.
Jimmy Fallon,"The TSA said that you need to check food ‘if you can spread it, spill it, pump it, or pour it.’ People are like, ‘Thanks for saying that in the creepiest way possible.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Two huge storms are brewing that are expected to wreak havoc across the country. Yup, two major storms—all I’m saying is that if the storms knock out the wifi or TV on Thanksgiving, God help us all."
Jimmy Fallon,Those aren’t turkey names. Peach and Blossom sound like the special guests at a bachelor party.
Jimmy Fallon,"Yup, Biden promised that the turkeys would not get killed this November. Democrats were like, ‘Hey that’s what you said to us.'"
Jimmy Fallon,I hope everyone enjoyed the pardoning because next Thanksgiving those turkeys will be Matt Gaetz and Rudy Giuliani.
Jimmy Fallon,McDonald’s announced that the McRib is coming back for the holidays. You can always tell when McDonald’s is in trouble. They either bring back the McRib or Monopoly.
Jimmy Kimmel,"17,000 flights have been delayed or cancelled since Friday. Which I think is all of them."
Jimmy Kimmel,It’s kind of miraculous these turkeys were able to get pardons without Ryan Murphy even doing a show about them on Netflix.
Jimmy Kimmel,You know when Trump is back in office they’ll be delivering that tree on a Cybertruck with a big pair of TruckNutz on the back.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Matt Gaetz will not be joining team Trump, but he did join Cameo over the weekend. That’s right, last week he was a congressman nominated for Attorney General, this week he’s begging for money on the same website as the lady from Chimp Crazy and the Rizzler."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This is the circle of disgraced politicians life now. Congress, Cameo, next thing you know you’re a banana on The Masked Singer ."
Jimmy Kimmel,Let’s hope Matt’s Cameo goes better than his Venmo went.
Jimmy Kimmel,"She actually has a lot of experience, she was the lead on Surgeon General Hospital for years."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Great lesson. Remember kids, stay in school and do drugs."
Jimmy Kimmel,He believes in every drug except the ones that keep you alive.
Jimmy Kimmel,RFK Jr. has a lot of skeletons and whale carcasses in his closet.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The number of vasectomies the United States has skyrocketed. Vasectomies were up 1,200 percent on November 6. And that’s the sign of a great incoming president, when people start getting all their healthcare in before it becomes illegal. When people stop wanting to have children."
