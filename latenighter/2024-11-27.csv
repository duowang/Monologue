Seth Meyers,"President-elect Trump announced last night on Truth Social that he will implement tariffs on goods imported from Canada, China, and Mexico. So next year if you want extra guacamole it’ll be cheaper to go get it."
Seth Meyers,"President-elect Trump is reportedly planning a series of actions to boost fossil fuels as soon as he takes office, including a rollback of tax credits for electric vehicles. That’s how you thank Elon Musk? ‘Look, now that I’ve won, I’ve gotta say, your car is ridiculous.'"
Seth Meyers,A cat in Washington state was rescued recently after it got stuck up a tree for five days. They were finally able to get it down after explaining that a lot of Trump’s cabinet picks probably won’t be confirmed by the Senate.
Seth Meyers,"The New York Times published an article this week about president-elect Trump’s aide, former right-wing television anchor Natalie Harp, who Trump reportedly calls, ‘Sweetie.’ Melania also has a nickname for her but I can’t say it on TV."
Seth Meyers,"President-elect Trump’s new border czar Tom Homan is set to visit the US-Mexico border with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. That’s fine, but I don’t get this obsession with physically going down to the border. What do you think you’re going to see, the problem. Ohhh, somebody left this gate open. Solved it!'"
Seth Meyers,"In a new interview, Homan said he’s putting together an extensive deportation plan and added that the plan will be ‘public safety threats, national security threats, and fugitives.’ So it looks like Trump’s gonna have to replace most of his cabinet."
Seth Meyers,"According to a new survey, the average American man has three close friends. Which, if you’re over 30, are coworkers, brother-in-law, and that guy at the gym, I think his name’s Greg."
Seth Meyers,"Krispy Kreme has unveiled its holiday donut collection, which is inspired by Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas . And if you eat enough of them, your heart will grow three sizes."
Jimmy Fallon,"Apparently Trump’s tariffs on Mexico will cause the price of Modelo and Corona beer to go up. Every MAGA supporter was like, ‘Well, I guess it’s time to forgive Bud Light.'"
Jimmy Fallon,It’s not good. Mexico is where we get 90 percent of our avocados and Canada is where we get 100 percent of our hot Ryans.

Jimmy Fallon,"Luckily there’s no turkey shortage this year, though. I remember the year Biden had to walk up to the turkeys he just pardoned and say, “Fellas I got some bad news.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"President Biden and the First Lady plan to attend president-elect Trump’s inauguration. Which is why the theme of Trump’s inauguration speech will be, ‘Awkwaaaard.'"
Jimmy Fallon,I feel like Biden’s going to spend the entire speech looking into the camera like Jim from The Office .
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday at the Boston airport an American Airlines plane clipped the wing of a Frontier Airlines plane. Yep, then Frontier charged everyone on board a $50 collision fee."
Jimmy Kimmel,"So now if you want to purchase a tie from the Donald J. Trump collection , you’d better get it immediately or it’s going to cost an extra 10 percent."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Canada is like, ‘What did we do? Is this because of Drake?'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Meanwhile, the Tariff of Nottingham is making good on those tariffs he promised."

Jimmy Kimmel,"But don’t worry, you can still find her on OnlyFanatics."
Jimmy Kimmel,There is something kind of refreshing about that fact that these people don’t even pretend to be doing jobs any more.
Jimmy Kimmel,"35 percent of Americans consider turkey to be their least favorite Thanksgiving dish. Which, I don’t know. Turkey’s kind of like the Aquaman of Thanksgiving. It might not be your favorite, but the Justice League just isn’t complete without him."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Once again at the top of the list, the most popular Thanksgiving food is—the 10-milligram pot gummy you eat in the car on the way to your in-laws’."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Another important study shows that Trump voters are more likely to bring up the election than Kamala Harris voters. And that 36 percent of Trump voters are actually planning to bring it up at Thanksgiving dinner, which means that now might be a good time to get that Covid you’ve been wanting all year."
