Jimmy Kimmel,"In other words, the Biden presidency has now entered the ‘grandpa doesn’t give a damn about what you think’ phase."
Jimmy Kimmel,Now I’m no presidential historian but I believe this is the first time a U.S. president has pardoned both his son and a turkey in the same week.
Jimmy Kimmel,He dropped the pardon out of nowhere like it was a Kendrick Lamar album.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I wonder if Joe now has to get Hunter anything for Christmas. This is good enough, right?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"They have to be kidding, right? Everyone who voted to let a 34-time convicted felon off the hook is very mad about Joe Biden letting his son off the hook."
Jimmy Kimmel,Every pizza place in America’s about to have its doors kicked in by the FBI looking for baby meat in the pepperoni.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yes, I am a normal adult man who wrote a book in which Donald Trump is king and I am his wizard—for kids."
Jimmy Kimmel,Not only did Trump pardon his son-in-law Jared’s dad—who went to prison for hiring a hooker to frame his own brother-in-law—this weekend he named that same man Ambassador to France.
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump also announced this weekend that his new senior advisor on Arab and Middle Eastern Affairs is his daughter Tiffany’s father-in-law. It’s like he gave everyone at the dinner table on Thanksgiving a position in his administration.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Cyber Monday is followed by Giving Tuesday, and Stolen Amazon Package Wednesday."
Stephen Colbert,"I think this pardon proves that, with less than two months to go, Joe is officially out of malarkeys. And by malarkeys, I mean f**ks."
Stephen Colbert,So it’s less of a blanket pardon and more of a tarp.
Stephen Colbert,"And I get why they’d be angry. Does Biden’s word mean nothing? Can we trust anything he says? When he goes, ‘I’m serious folks, I’m not kidding around, no joke,’ was he in fact kidding around, yes joke?"
Stephen Colbert,"I don’t know if it was the right thing to do, but you certainly earned that World’s Greatest Dad mug."
Stephen Colbert,What seems clear is that Trump is purposely appointing people who promise to destroy the thing they’ve been appointed to run. Next he’s going to replace Smokey the Bear with Flame-O the Arsonist.
Stephen Colbert,"Evidently, Trump thought Wray wasn’t enough of a loyalist and soured on him within months. I’m not surprised. It’s hard to keep the spark alive when it’s always FBI and never FB-Us."
Stephen Colbert,It is really unpleasant to mix conspiracy theories and children’s stories. That’s why bookstores sold hardly any copies of Goodnight We Never Landed On the Moon .
Stephen Colbert,"You know what would be really funny? This would be really funny—if Joe pardoned, like, every late-night host. And just because I think it would be a funny bit, I would accept that pardon."
Stephen Colbert,"Apparently Pete’s a bit of a workaholic. In that at work, he’s an alcoholic."
Stephen Colbert,"He has already been accused of a drunken sexual assault, and one newly released whistleblower report says that from 2013-2016 Hegseth was repeatedly intoxicated in his official capacity as the president of Concerned Veterans for America, including one episode where Hegseth had to be restrained while drunk from joining the dancers on the stage at a Louisiana strip club. That is truly a sad and pathetic image but, fun fact, in a Louisiana strip club, the G in G-string stands for gumbo.” stephen colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"According to the whistleblower, Hegseth and other members of his management team sexually pursued the organization’s female staffers, who they divided into two groups, the ‘party girls’ and the ‘not party girls.’ Eventually both groups became known as the ‘can we please work from home’ girls."
Stephen Colbert,"But those allegations of course are all from coworkers, and Hegseth is a family man. And apparently they don’t like him either."
Stephen Colbert,"an abuser of women” who “belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego"
Jon Stewart,"Why this weekend? Normally you drop a controversial pardon like the way you buy porn at a gas station. In a flurry of other distracting purposes and pardons. ‘Uh, would you give me those breath mints there, that WD-40, that squeegee there, one of those anal magazines, some Corn Nuts, a pardon for my son, the Big Dicks Like Chicks pamphlet.'"
Jon Stewart,"Eleven years is a very specific and not rounded amount of time. ‘So Hunter, I’ll give you a pardon. Five years, ten years.’ ‘It needs to be eleven. And if you would be so kind, make sure this upcoming New Year’s Eve is also covered.'"
Jon Stewart,"Thanksgiving! I knew it. Perhaps I can explain how this pardon went down in my new one man show, Can You Get Hunter to Stop Looking at Me Like That?"
Jon Stewart,"Your dad always told you that? Were you a degenerate or was your dad De Niro? ‘Listen to me, you get pinched, I’m not your first phone call. I don’t know you. There’s ten grand a gun in the floorboards. Good luck kid.'"
Jon Stewart,"F**k you, Joe Biden” on her podcast] “Megyn Kelly who do you think you are? Me? What am I supposed to say now?"
Jon Stewart,"‘Oh you pardoned your son, what about the people who helped me try to overthrow the government?’ There’s kind of a leap there. It’s like going, ‘Oh you’re gonna let the kid stay up to watch SNL but you’re not gonna even try to help me burn the neighbor’s house down?'"
Jon Stewart,‘I did not meet with Russia in a box. I did not meet with Russia on Fox. I did not meet them in Trump Tower. I did not have a golden shower.'
Jimmy Fallon,Democrats are divided. Some of them are upset while others are Hunter Biden.
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s kind of nice, it’s like for his last act as President, Biden united the country."
Jimmy Fallon,It is so cold today that I saw a squirrel in Central Park deep-frying his nuts.
Jimmy Fallon,"After Cyber Monday it’s Regret Ordering From Temu Tuesday. Then there’s Finally Find All the Captcha Images With Crosswalks Wednesday. Then Amazon Package Stolen Off Your Front Porch Friday, then Catch Your Neighbor Steve Wearing Your Scarf Saturday, and finally, Realize You Should Have Shopped Sober Sunday."
