Ronny Chieng,"Okay South Korea, stop giving Trump ideas. He didn’t know you could do that."
Ronny Chieng,"Good old Asian efficiency. The president went nuts, declared martial law, the assembly overruled him, martial law over, and they did it all on their lunch break, all right. Everybody, get back to doing K-Pop, chop-chop!"
Ronny Chieng,"Donald Trump has spent the last two weeks filling out his cabinet. And now that Matt Gaetz has dropped out to try to find the high school from Euphoria , there’s a new nominee for shadiest nominee. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense and guy with resting divorce face."
Ronny Chieng,"Okay, that’s a lot for one person. Alcohol, sex, and financial misconduct? I mean it’s called delegating, bud, try it some time."
Ronny Chieng,"Wow. Do you know how hard it is to be the saddest thing at a strip club? A half-naked pregnant woman dancing to pay her medical bills was looking at him like, ‘Damn, this guy needs to get some help.'"
Ronny Chieng,"I don’t know what’s worse, that he reportedly divided his staff into ‘party girls’ and ‘not party girls’ or that he couldn’t think of a word for ‘not party.’ He’s a bit of a caveman, isn’t he? ‘When the sun in sky, day. When sun go away, not day. Time for party girls.'"
Ronny Chieng,"When he joined this veterans charity, did he think he was the veteran it was going to? ‘Guys, it would really help my mental health to go to this strip club, okay? I have PTSD: Party Time S**k My D**k!'"
Ronny Chieng,"Okay, I’m putting mom down as not a party girl."
Jimmy Fallon,The pardon is upsetting a lot of people. Experts say this could really hurt Biden’s reelection bid in 2028.
Jimmy Fallon,"Today Trump was like, ‘Word of advice, have 50 scandals at once so people can’t focus on just one.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Trump’s gonna take one step inside the church and it’s gonna burst right back into flames.
Jimmy Fallon,Frontier Airlines today announced that they’re introducing first class-style seats. First class-style is still not first class. It’s like hearing that Velveeta now has 100 percent real cheese products.
Jimmy Fallon,"The CDC today said that the McDonald’s E. Coli outbreak is over. Yup, E. Coli is gone. Apparently whatever’s in the McRib killed it."
Stephen Colbert,"I’m guessing his family’s not thrilled with it, either. It’s gonna be hard for Jill to match that Christmas gift. ‘Oh what’s this, memory foam slippers, thank you. Thanks mom—by any chance to these give me a decade of immunity from federal prosecution? No? Okay, is there a gift receipt?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, not too sure how much interest Americans have in the idea of justice right now. After all, we had an election and we did just reelect a guy whose slogan was, ‘Trump 2024: Like My Crime? Then Hit Me Baby One More Time.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The opening ceremonies ar e this Sunday, and the restored cathedral will be celebrated with massive pyrotechnics, a fire-eater, and an exhibit of Europe’s most oily rags."
Stephen Colbert,"The French are so happy, they celebrated the only way they know how—a three-way."
Stephen Colbert,And we make tons of stuff in the USA. Did you know that we’re the world’s largest producer of Real Housewives?
Stephen Colbert,"And without any of those, how will Americans get their recommended daily amount of things that go bad in the fridge."
Stephen Colbert,No beer or pickup trucks? Trump better not put a tariff on a pair of blue jeans that fit just right or we’re gonna run out of country songs.
Stephen Colbert,The official theme is ‘a season of peace and light.’ Which is much more hopeful than all the other Democrats’ theme: ‘Drink three old fashioneds and openly weep in front of Charlie Brown.'
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s expected to be a nice, very pleasant trip for the president-elect to enjoy Paris before he takes office. And of course for his wife Melania to enjoy wherever she will be this weekend."
Jimmy Kimmel,"McDonald Trump is heading to France this weekend to witness the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral. And if all goes according to plan, he would like to buy it and turn it into a casino."
Jimmy Kimmel,with your convictions and mine
