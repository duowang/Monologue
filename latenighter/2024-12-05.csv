Stephen Colbert,"We’ve got 20 shopping days ’til Christmas. And if you want to get something for Donald Trump, you might think about a new Secretary of Defense."
Stephen Colbert,Trump only knew about Hegseth from seeing him on TV as one of the hosts of Fox & Friends Weekend. You know their slogan: The Only Way Grandpa Knows It’s Saturday.
Stephen Colbert,Word is Trump’s support for Hegseth is teetering. Much like Pete Hegseth at a staff meeting.
Stephen Colbert,"He’s right, he doesn’t have a drinking problem. He just keeps drinking and the problem goes away. It’s Pete Hegseth’s 12-step program. Step one: Admit that you are powerless over alcohol. Then: Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Tequila!"
Stephen Colbert,"In Hegseth’s defense, none of the sources could recall an instance where Hegseth missed a scheduled appearance because he’d been drinking. And that’s great. Because you know what everyone says when the drunk guy shows up at work, ‘Oh good… you’re here.'"
Stephen Colbert,"According to an NBC report, Hegeth’s drinking worried colleagues at Fox News. Reached for comment, Judge Jeanine Pirro said, ‘Ahgusasinfarp.'"
Stephen Colbert,there won’t be a drop of alcohol on [his] lips
Stephen Colbert,"While DeSantis actually does have some defense qualifications, the replacement isn’t a done deal because some in Trump’s orbit ‘strongly dislike DeSantis.’ Wow, that is a weird way to find out I’m in Trump’s orbit."
Stephen Colbert,"And if none of those people work out, Trump could always turn to the anchor of Fox’s 3 a.m. panel show, Stars & Gripes With Ardsley Blondeteeth ."
Stephen Colbert,That’s actually really impressive. Do you know how hard it is to throw a surprise martial law? You have to get the entire military to hide behind the couch and then be quiet at the same time. [Whispering] ‘Turn off the tank!'
Stephen Colbert,"Oh no, if Trump ever declares martial law, we’re screwed. Our Congress is way too old to climb fences. I mean, it’s a nail-biter every time they get into a bathtub."
Stephen Colbert,You never make a good decision at 11 p.m. on a Tuesday. You’re either starting a third glass of chardonnay and a new season of Bake Off or you’re declaring martial law.
Stephen Colbert,"In total, his entire coup lasted a total of six hours. making it the shortest attempted coup since… well, you know."
Stephen Colbert,That is the most threatening coffee table book since Anne Geddes’ I Have All Your Babies .
Jimmy Kimmel,"His current nominee, Pete Hegseth, who he picked from TV like a necklace he saw on QVC, is about to be Penta-gone after allegations of sexual misconduct and drunken behavior."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s also promised that if he gets confirmed by the Senate, he will stop drinking. But if not, he’s storming the Captol Grille at happy hour."
Jimmy Kimmel,And if you’re wondering what qualifications Ron DeSantis has to run the Pentagon—you are correct to wonder that.
Jimmy Kimmel,"But at least Ron DeSantis is the governor of a state and he does have military experience. He served in the Navy as a JAG officer—he’s a real JAG OFFicer,this guy.” jimmy kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"This started in 2015 when somebody at Spotify asked, ‘Hey, you know, why shouldn’t corporate surveillance be fun?'"
Jimmy Kimmel,These reports from Spotify have become a gentle yearly reminder that I’m white and that I will soon be dead.
Jimmy Kimmel,"For anyone who is buying this crap, just give the man your ATM card and PIN number and get it over with already, will you?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"YMCA” to the Trump campaign means it’s not really a gay anthem] “Right, it’s not just a gay anthem, it’s the gay anthem."
Ronny Chieng,"Wow, this would be very sobering news for Pete Hegseth if he wasn’t sh*t-faced right now."
Ronny Chieng,"Okay, before you judge, yes his show starts at 6:00 in the morning. But he was still drinking from the night before, so it’s not sad, it’s awesome."
Ronny Chieng,"Again, his show airs at 6 a.m., but as Pete Hegseth always says, ‘Hey, it’s 11 o’clock somewhere.'"
Ronny Chieng,But this might be for the best. The first step toward sobriety is your coworkers admitting you have a problem.
Ronny Chieng,"It’s weird that we’re arguing about the drinking, because even if he was stone-cold sober he’s a TV host who ran two veterans organizations into the ground. He’s not qualified to run the Pentagon anyway, okay? This is like saying, ‘Hey, yo, that cat can’t be pilot, he has a drinking problem!'"
Ronny Chieng,"Honestly, I kind of feel bad for this guy. I mean, he had it made. A cushy job on Fox News, a side-hustle selling macho garbage on right-wing Instagram, a loving third family. Then Trump comes along and offers him a job and now his life is kind of f**ked up. I mean, who could have seen that coming, other than Matt Gaetz, Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Michael Cohen, and everyone else Trump has ever come into contact with.” ronny chieng"
Ronny Chieng,What kind of parent-teacher conference are we watching right now? Because the future Secretary of Defense needs his mom to come on to defend him? I thought you were against women in combat roles?
Ronny Chieng,"I never saw Donald Rumsfeld be like, ‘I have a warning for the Taliban—mom, you tell ’em.'"
Ronny Chieng,fake news” on her own email] “What misinformation? You wrote the email. You’re the one who told us he’s a piece of sh*t.
Ronny Chieng,"By the way, seven years ago isn’t ancient history. We still have the same Spider-Man."
Ronny Chieng,I mean that uncle is either very concerned for democracy or very concerned about what people are going to see on his phone.
Unknown,It has now come to light that Hegseth may have a slight work problem when he shows up at drinking.
Jimmy Fallon,"[President-elect Trump is considering replacing Pete Hegseth with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as his nominee for Defense Secretary. When asked why he’d hire Ron DeSantis, Trump said, ‘Because it’d be really fun to fire Ron DeSantis.'” jimmy fallon"
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night Trump’s pick to lead the drug enforcement agency withdrew his name from consideration. He was like, ‘Yeah, I didn’t know there’d be a drug test.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Today you’re either sharing your Spotify Wrapped or realizing you listen to a little too much Sabrina Carpenter for a 50-year-old man.
Jimmy Fallon,"I really do love when the Christmas tree is here because for six weeks, instead of weed the city smells like pine—sorry, pine-scented weed."
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, besides the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and the tree-lighting, it’s basically lip-sync week on NBC."
Jimmy Fallon,"Normally if sitting on someone’s lap costs $165, you’re not at the mall."
Jimmy Fallon,A German man is more than 60 days into his attempt to break the world record for longest time spent living under water. At least we hope.
