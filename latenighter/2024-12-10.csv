Seth Meyers,"Can’t guarantee tomorrow? When Trump said Make America Great Again, was he only talking about until the close of business hours?"
Seth Meyers,"What? When you were campaigning, you were guaranteeing everything. Prices will come down, America will be respected, and now that you’ve won you’re coming off like an inspirational Instagram post. ‘Tomorrow is not guaranteed, my friends, live to the fullest.'"
Seth Meyers,"‘That’s right, before we do anything, we have to deport the cameras.'"
Seth Meyers,"I mean yeah, bud, you’re right. It’s gonna be horrible. Did you forget you were describing your own plan? ‘Whoever came up with that idea’s gonna regret it, that’s one stupid son of a bitch.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"This guy, he’s got no facts left to give."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump believes that if you want American citizenship, you have to do it the old fashioned way. You have to move here from Slovenia, get a modeling contract, and marry the first orange millionaire you meet."
Jimmy Kimmel,She asked him about his inauguration speech. He said the speech will focus on unity—he’s against it.
Jimmy Kimmel,Doesn’t everyone look suspicious at a McDonald’s? Just sitting down and eating there is suspicious.
Jimmy Kimmel,Maybe if Steve-O had written a better book he would have just hit the guy in the nuts with a tee-ball bat.
Jimmy Kimmel,He had to use that one because he doesn’t have a picture of his own wife smiling at him.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Even after all these years, Trump still can’t tell when a woman is faking it."
Jimmy Kimmel,And as a Mets fan I am very excited to see how terribly this will inevitably go for us.
Stephen Colbert,"Not exactly what you want to hear from the guy who’s about to have the nuclear codes. It’s like your heart surgeon saying, ‘Before I put you under, you should know—I can’t guarantee tomorrow. I mean it’s pretty intense in there and it’s pretty hard to fight the urge to squeeze your ticker like a stress ball.'"
Stephen Colbert,Pride month is different there.
Stephen Colbert,"No, Syrian rebels! I get that you’re happy, end of tyranny, blah-blah. But metal tyrant heads go in a separate bin, and are only picked up on the fourth Tuesday of the month. Plus, did you wash it out first?"
Stephen Colbert,"Nothing to see here, folks. He just wants to jail his political opponents. But hey, on the bright side, 13 years from now, maybe rebels will be taking a fun sleigh ride on a statue of him."
Stephen Colbert,You know that guy’s Italian because you could grate parmesan on those abs.
Stephen Colbert,[Police] obtained the suspect’s DNA from a discarded Starbucks water bottle. They also found a discarded latte from the murder suspect which was labeled ‘Mordor Saucepack.'
Stephen Colbert,That’s 18 hours on a Greyhound. Prison holds no fear for this man.
Stephen Colbert,You know Greyhound’s slogan: What if a port-a-potty was stuck in traffic?
Stephen Colbert,"In response, Dr. Biden used the photo to sell her new line of pepper spray."
Stephen Colbert,"I’m sorry, that’s copyright infringement. There’s already a cologne called Fight Fight Fight, and it’s called tequila."
Stephen Colbert,I’m surprised they would let Trump visit a cathedral that had just burned down. Because if he gets too close to the holy water he’s gonna burst into flames.
Jimmy Fallon,"Donald Trump just sat down for an interview with Meet the Press where he said that he wants to end birthright citizenship, pardon the January 6 defendants, and put Liz Cheney in jail. Well, some people’s New Year’s resolutions are darker than others."
Jimmy Fallon,It’s perfect if you want to smell like a Big Mac that’s been sitting in a tanning bed and then thrown into the back of a Cybertruck.
Jimmy Fallon,"A truck in California caught on fire and left 30,000 pounds of melted chocolate on the highway. Firefighters showed up and said, ‘God, let that be 30,000 pounds of melted chocolate on the highway.'"
Jon Stewart,It’s like some kind of Syrian version of a Club Med banana boat.
Jon Stewart,"A quick word to the other remaining despots in the Middle East. It is my deepest hope that when you see this footage, you realize, once and for all, that you are really skimping on statue structural integrity."
Jon Stewart,"Yes, Putin has given Assad humanitarian asylum—and then sent him immediately to go fight in Ukraine."
Jon Stewart,I think no leader can go wrong in their exile choice by posing one simple question to themselves: What would Steven Seagal do?
Jon Stewart,‘Conquest of mercy and love?’ I think that’s how Taylor ended the Eras Tour. The new leader of Syria’s a Swifite? How many terror groups is that guy in?
Jon Stewart,"I get it. Who amongst us hasn’t gone through an emo phase, or goth phase, or a 9/11 phase?"
Jon Stewart,"And normally I would say snitches get stitches, but obviously without pre-approval…"
Jon Stewart,"You won. You don’t have to push merch any more. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but—this is beneath you."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Do you have any idea how attractive you have to be for a McDonald’s employee to be like, ‘Okay, you being in here is suspicious.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Anyone on dating apps knows, anyone can take one sexy, blurry candid right before they commit a murder."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, because that’s what people want when they’re drunk and high getting late-night tacos—evidence."
