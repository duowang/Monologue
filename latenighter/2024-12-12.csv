Seth Meyers,"Trump claimed he won because he was in touch with the needs of working people and he’s following through by assembling a cabinet of regular, blue collar Americans who understand what it’s like to struggle to make ends meet and I’m just f**king with you—it’s like a sh*t-ton of billionaires."
Seth Meyers,"Trump’s cabinet of billionaires is going to enforce loyalty among Republicans. Now if you had to guess, what do you think would be the top priority of the wealthiest administration in history? If you guessed lowering prescription drug costs and reining in corporate price-gouging, you gotta get better at guessing because that was a really bad guess."
Seth Meyers,Nothing more out of touch than a billionaire dressed like a garbage man explaining to us what groceries are. This is like if the Met Gala thought it would be cute to do Janitor Chic.
Seth Meyers,One thing I can guarantee is than none of those people ever had to buy their own f**king groceries. They’re probably the only people in the world who do believe Trump invented the word. ‘You mean those stores that sell all of that loose food?'
Seth Meyers,"So how are they gonna pay for the 4 trillion dollars in tax cuts? If you guessed cutting defense spending, tax loopholes, and corporate subsidies, you in general need to stop guessing, ‘cause it’s not your thing. seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,naughty and nice” lists of Republicans willing to submit to Trump] “The only thing Musk and Santa Claus have in common is they both need a magic sleigh to get higher than an inch in the air.
Seth Meyers,"by even one day”] “I have to admit, it would be objectively funny to raise the retirement age by one day. ‘Sorry Frank, give me back that gold watch, we’ll see you on Monday. Don’t you dare touch that cake in the break room!'"
Stephen Colbert,Well I think it’s fitting that America’s top law enforcement officer is timing his resignation to coincide with the end of law.
Stephen Colbert,This news doesn’t come as a shock because Donald Trump has repeatedly indicated he would fire him. And that’s not surprising. The president-elect has had it out for Wray ever since Wray was appointed by a man who nearly destroyed Trump’s political career—Donald Trump.
Stephen Colbert,"That’s not a manifesto, that’s a mini-festo."
Stephen Colbert,He could have just made it a Yelp review. ‘American healthcare sucks. One star.'
Stephen Colbert,"Well at least he apologized. Reminds me of what Manson said after his murders, ‘Whoops, my bad.'"
Stephen Colbert,Uh huh. Good start. What else shouldn’t you have done?
Stephen Colbert,People are so angry at the American healthcare system that they’re treating him like a folk hero. And before we go any further I just want to say something that I know takes courage. And I don’t care how many viewers this costs me. [Takes off glasses for emphasis] I believe murder is wrong.
Stephen Colbert,"free Luigi” merch, including dog bandanas] “Y’all knock it off, don’t make your dog wear murderer stuff. It’s Christmas, make him wear the plush reindeer antlers that he hates."
Stephen Colbert,Well I hope you’re happy. You guys made the money sad.
Stephen Colbert,"Clearly Don Jr. went to his dad and said, ‘Hey dad I got a hot new girlfriend. Can you do me a solid and send the old one to the other side of the planet?'"
Stephen Colbert,"I’m sorry, what? [Choking up] I’m sorry, I just need a minute. This one hurts—because you let yourself believe in love just a little bit and then [hits chest] stupid heart, stupid heart, stupid heart. I don’t want to learn a whole new lady!"
Stephen Colbert,He’s not totally wrong there. Being engaged to Don Jr. has given Guilfoyle a lot of experience with grease.
Stephen Colbert,Well now we know why Guilfoyle’s getting an ambassadorship on her way out the door. She’s clearly got pics of Don Jr.’s junior don.
Stephen Colbert,"Former Fox News host and woman who gets her filler done at Build-a-Bear, Kimberly Guilfoyle."
Stephen Colbert,"There’s also been trouble brewing for Trump’s HHS nominee and last living California Raisin, RFK Jr."
Michael Kosta,"Okay, ‘I don’t really know what I’m talking about’ is a surprising thing to put in a manifesto. This is the first murder manifesto I’ve read that could have ended with, ‘But no worries if not.'"
Michael Kosta,"You never hear the Taliban be like, ‘Death to America… but we’re not experts, so grain of salt.'"
Michael Kosta,"‘He looked at me, he saw me, we had a moment, and, Nora I’m getting reports just now that I can change him.'"
Michael Kosta,"Can I just say, this is confusing as a straight man to me. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do to attract women. One day it’s do more work around the house, the next it’s be a better listener, and now apparently it’s execute the leader of a Fortune 500 company."
Michael Kosta,"Wow, what a great way to end a relationship. Forget about, ‘Listen it’s not you, it’s me.’ Now we’ve got, ‘Listen, how would you like to be the ambassador to Greece?'"
Michael Kosta,‘Does he piss martinis and sh*t olives? No? Well give this man security clearance!'
Michael Kosta,"I’m sorry, but ‘He’s not drunk every second of his life,’ it’s a pretty low bar. Which, by the way, is the only bar that Pete Hegseth hasn’t been thrown out of."
Michael Kosta,"Look, you can argue what the exact definition of a drinking problem is, but I think a good barometer is, is everyone in the country talking about how much you drink? Then you probably have a drinking problem."
Michael Kosta,"Look, plenty of people having drinking problems"
Michael Kosta,"Ultimately it’s worse if you’re an alcoholic in certain jobs. Like, you don’t want to have an alcoholic pilot. But a drunk Daily Show host? What’s the worst that can happen? I pee myself behind the desk and I need LaToya to bring me new pants, right now, LaToya, new pants…"
Michael Kosta,It’s good enough for me. When has an alcoholic ever promised to do better and not followed through?
Michael Kosta,"‘Just put me in charge of the largest military in history and I’ll stop drinking. By the way, Jell-O shots don’t count as drinking, that’s eating. That’s a solid.'"
Michael Kosta,"All right, I think I speak for everyone when I say, sir, no you couldn’t."
Michael Kosta,"But still, there’s a big difference between alcoholism and eating. No one’s ever said, ‘Dad, you came home full again.'"
Michael Kosta,"Let’s begin with the story that everyone is still talking about, the arrest of Luigi Mangione. Alleged CEO killer and the reason ‘conjugal visit’ is trending on Google."
Michael Kosta,"Things are a little rockier for Pete Hegseth, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense and veteran of multiple tours with Captain Morgan."
Jimmy Kimmel,It’s so crazy to think that Donald Trump working the French fry machine was only the second weirdest thing to happen at a McDonald’s in a Pennsylvania this year.
Jimmy Kimmel,"In this country, if you get sick or you’re severely disabled and your health insurer won’t cover it, you’re out of luck. But if you do something violent to protest that, here’s your free attorney."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Many healthcare executives, these CEOs want you to know that they hear your frustration and they are doing something about it. They’re hiring private security. Your grandma can drop dead."
Jimmy Kimmel,"They say the average amount of time men spend on their site is the same amount of time their wives spend at the grocery store, minus eight seconds."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Wisconsin likes pee, which is a slogan they should definitely put on their license plates."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Colorado is into foot-jobs, which means that the next time Lauren Boebert goes to see Beetlejuice , she’ll have to take off her shoes."
Jimmy Kimmel,"In Iowa, the top search was ‘work trip.’ An Iowan’s sexiest fantasy is leaving Iowa."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Mangione is now lawyered up, which means we have the first new character in what is sure to be an ongoing crime drama, Altoona attorney Tom Dickey, who’s best known for his work playing Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit ."
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s the miracle, they made one Hanukkah movie to last 22 years."
Jimmy Kimmel,There are more Christmas movies starring dogs than there are Hanukkah movies starring people. There are more ways to spell the word Hanukkah than there are movies about Hanukkah.
Jimmy Fallon,"We’re officially only two weeks away from Christmas. Today every Amazon driver looked at their family and said, Well, see you in 2025."
Jimmy Fallon,"The postal service was like, ‘Don’t be fooled by text messages because we’re not even close to having that technology.'"
