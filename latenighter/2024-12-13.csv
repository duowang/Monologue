name,monologue
Michael Kosta,Let’s begin with Time magazine. Every year they reveal their Person of the Year so that people can remember that Time magazine still exists.
Michael Kosta,"That’s the most unenthusiastic reveal I’ve ever seen. That’s how I act when my sister gives me scented lotion for Christmas. ‘Okay, there it is. Pomegranate Dream, thank you.'"
Michael Kosta,And why did they put Kamala Harris on the list? I know they’re trying to pay her some respect but all they did was make her lose to Donald Trump again.
Michael Kosta,"Yeah you know, never in America should an old woman be forced to return an apple to the refrigerator at the grocery store, where they always keep the apples."
Michael Kosta,"Now that poor old woman can’t afford her three-apple lunch. She can only afford two apples, and if she’s anything like the old women I see at my grocery store, and her carton of cigarettes and scratch-off tickets."
Michael Kosta,"By the way, that old woman’s name? Granny Smith."
Michael Kosta,"That’s right, unidentified flying objects over New Jersey. Or as they call them in New Jersey, ‘unidentified f**kin’ objects, ohhh!'"
Michael Kosta,"Mysterious drones in the sky are scary. And they raise a lot of questions, like can they shoot me? And after the year this has been, can they please shoot me?"
Michael Kosta,"Holy sh*t, there’s an Iranian mother ship launching drones off the east coast? Oh, you know what, probably to gather intelligence on New Jersey’s rich tapestries of shopping malls."
Michael Kosta,"Look, I know some of you are like, ‘Hey can you stop making fun of New Jersey?’ You elected this guy. No."
Michael Kosta,mothership” off New Jersey] “No mothership? So what you telling me is Iran doesn’t have Independence Day technology?
Stephen Colbert,It is a decision that always sends shockwaves through my dentist’s waiting room in 2003.
Stephen Colbert,Floating white spots on a black background. A chilling image that cannot be faked unless you close your eyes and push on your eyelids a little bit.
Stephen Colbert,"Witnesses say they’re as large as a car. Meaning not only is it capable of autonomous flight, it probably has cup holders."
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, military research facilities in New Jersey. No doubt run by the CI-Eyyyyy!"
Stephen Colbert,That alone proves these drones are not of this world. Because no human being is capable of changing their car clock.
Stephen Colbert,"C-SPAN 3, you know their slogan: We have no budget for a slogan."
Stephen Colbert,[Singing] ‘They’re making a list. Checking it twice/Gonna find out who’s naughty or nice/ Santa Claus is coming…” stephen colbert
Stephen Colbert,"In Maryland, the top search was ‘girlfriend.’ Dorks!!!"
Stephen Colbert,naked women”] “That’s clearly Amish teens on Rumspringa getting their first crack at a computer.
Stephen Colbert,"Congratulations to both Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco. Or as they’re known by their celebrity couple name, Selena Gomez."
Stephen Colbert,"Wow, I did not know he had 39 sons."
Stephen Colbert,I believe that is an empathetic and generous act of forgiveness and hope… that will be knocked out of the headlines as soon as Trump threatens to bomb Manilla because he cut himself on one of their envelopes.
Stephen Colbert,"But if you ban booze on the subway during SantaCon, you’re sentencing these young men to up to 20 minutes of not drinking. That means less festive light pole climbing and more quietly thinking about their dads."
Jimmy Kimmel,Sadly there’s no one left to roll it up and spank him with it.
Jimmy Kimmel,It was a no-brainer in every sense of the word.
Jimmy Kimmel,He jammed his little finger on that bell like it was the Diet Coke button in the Oval Office.
Jimmy Kimmel,That is Donald Trump’s ‘Freebird.'
Jimmy Fallon,Trump is the first man ever to be Time ’s Person of the Year and McDonald’s Employee of the Month.
Jimmy Fallon,Trump said the honor feels just as exciting as the birth of his child except he was present at the award.
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump invited the President of China to attend his inauguration but he didn’t invite Vladimir Putin. Today the UN issued a statement that said, ‘Now if you invite one dictator you have to invite the whole class.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Yup, Chili’s versus Applebee’s. This might be the only peace agreement that Trump is qualified to negotiate."
Seth Meyers,My only issue is this glamour shot of Trump in a pose I’ve literally never seen him take before. I mean I’ve only ever seen him screaming or slumped over so apologies if I’m not buying Donnie Contemplation over here.
Seth Meyers,"Before he was elected, he toured the country telling grandpas in folding chairs he was just like them, and as soon as he wins, he’s on a f**king marble balcony on Wall Street rocking a bell like he just ate a 72 ounce steak in less than an hour."
Seth Meyers,"Trump’s back-slapping trip to Wall Street is not an aberration and that’s the frustrating thing about voters who both consider the Democrats elites, which is fair, but then also vote for this guy. It’s like if my dad said he was cutting down on pretzels because he’s on a low-sodium diet but then he just started chugging Morton’s straight from the shaker."
Seth Meyers,"Wait what? You’re supposed to be the president. You sound like George Harrison at a press conference in 1968. [Liverpudlian accent] ‘Tomorrow isn’t guaranteed. A body is merely a vessel and it will one day return to earth, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna.'"
Seth Meyers,F**k me! I can’t believe we’ve really gotta spend the next four years watching this idiot relearn how hard it is to be president.
Seth Meyers,Also ‘It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up?’ You sound like a spokesperson for Boeing.
Seth Meyers,"[On Elon Musk getting an exponential return on the reported $277 million he spent getting Trump elected] “Ah yes, I remember those clips of reporters talking to working class voters in Midwestern diners. Hardscrabble folk struggling to get by, sitting down to drink their coffee and eat their eggs before they head off to the farm for the day. And reporters would say, ‘Which issue is most important to you, inflation, healthcare, housing?’ And they’d look up and say, ‘Ma’am, I just hope that Elon fella gets to $400 billion.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Democrats, you’re like a magician failing to pull off the easiest trick at a four-year-old’s birthday party. You know, at this point maybe just let Bernie take over. [Bernie Sanders voice]’You know who made that quarter disappear? It was the millionaires and the billionaires. 99 percent of the quarters are hiding behind the top one percent of ears.'"
Seth Meyers,You know what doesn’t happen in America? Grocery stores don’t keep the apples in the f**king refrigerator. That story has more holes in it than the final season of Lost .
Seth Meyers,"Who told you the story, the old woman or the woman at the counter? And by the way, if the best case scenario is the old woman buys three apples then maybe you should tell Republicans to stop floating cuts to Social Security. Because if you do cut Social Security, how are you ever gonna look this made up old woman in the eye again? She could be down to one apple!"
