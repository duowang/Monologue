Seth Meyers,"Did anyone think we’d start selling drones at convenience stores in America and there wouldn’t come a day when people were screaming, ‘There’s too many goddamn drones!'"
Seth Meyers,"It’s just for New Yorkers, New Jersey is like that next-door neighbor with the beaded curtains and weird smells and exotic wildlife in his house. And you say, ‘Honey, I think the guy next door has goats in his apartment, listen.'"
Seth Meyers,"a drone on steroids”] “All right, first of all, it’s New Jersey. Of course the drone is on steroids. Even the drone has to bulk up for beach season. That’s why the drone has been spotted with dumbbells and tanning oil."
Seth Meyers,"This whole drone freak-out is turning us into prehistoric Neanderthals. Don’t let these people anywhere near the Thanksgiving Day parade next year. ‘Everyone take cover!

The aliens are trying to make contact, listen!’ [Charlie Brown teacher “wah-wah-wah"

Seth Meyers,"But okay, sure, there’s an Iranian mothership off the coast of the Jersey Shore. Even worse, there was a plane playing a banner that said, ‘Death to America! And $3 Bud Lights Down at the Crab Shack.'"
Seth Meyers,"And I’m sorry, if there was a mothership off the coast of the United States close enough to launch a fleet of drones, I feel like we would see it, right? You know, based on the fact that we can see the drones. ‘The cloaking shields on the mothership are working well. The Americans can’t see us at all.’ ‘And just to check, we’re cloaking the drones too, right?’ ‘Ooooh, f**k, f**k, f**k!'"

Seth Meyers,That post is so crazy we don’t even have time to dwell on the fact that he misspelled ‘drone’ and ‘shoot.'

Unless, Brenda, though? Brenda’s a maybe?'"

Stephen Colbert,"He wants local police to shoot at anything in the sky… in December. Santa, I hope you have a kevlar sleigh. And don’t forget to take the battery out of Rudolph’s nose."
Stephen Colbert,"Now if you don’t know about polio, that’s because we got rid of it! You’re welcome!"
Stephen Colbert,"Reminds me of this famous quote [Video of FDR]: ‘The only thing we have to fear is… polio! Polio is bad, you idiots! Why do you think I use a wheelchair? I didn’t fall off a frickin’ surfboard!'"
Stephen Colbert,"RFK Jr’s lawyer is also fighting the distribution of 13 other vaccines, including hepatitis A, tetanus, and diphtheria. Look, if we’re gonna start bringing back diseases from the past, could we at least bring back some fun stuff, too? I want to smoke on an airplane. I want to throw lawn darts.

Jimmy Fallon,"Lawmakers just warned Apple that they should prepare to remove TikTok from the app store next month. In response, Apple said, ‘Absolutely, we’ll definitely remove TikTok, after just one more TikTok.'"
