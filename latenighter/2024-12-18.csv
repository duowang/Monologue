Stephen Colbert,"We are just a little over one week away from Christmas. And I would say I hope your stockings are hung by your chimney with care, your eggs are nogged, and your nuts are fully megged."
Stephen Colbert,"According to a new poll, Americans are over Christmas traditions. What? Christmas is traditions! You can’t be over them and still have Christmas. If you don’t put out your wooden shoes, how will Sinterklaas fill them with dried fruits and nut-meat? Think, Hans, think."

Stephen Colbert,"28 percent of respondents said that they’re open to swapping Elf on the Shelf.

Stephen Colbert,"Apparently there may be a Guinness-less Christmas as pubs run dry across the UK. One reason might be because what used to be seen as the drink of choice for middle-aged men has soared in popularity among younger women. Welcome younger women. Welcome to our world. Middle-aged men have all the best hobbies: dad bands, cargo shorts, taking pictures at graduation with an iPad."
Stephen Colbert,"You know it’s easy to get down about the potential collapse of democracy in America, but don’t forget to also get down about the potential collapse of democracy in other countries, too."

Stephen Colbert,"Even more challenging, Trudeau has to deal with Trump’s threats of a 25 percent tariff on Canadian imports. That would be a disaster for Canada. Three-quarters of their exports go to the United States: lumber, maple syrup, not to mention they’re our number one supplier of Dry. What are we gonna import now, Polish Wet? You know their motto: You drink wet now."
Stephen Colbert,"There’s a political crisis around Canadian Prime Minster and Disney prince who’s so boring you’d rather hook up with a talking candlestick, Justin Trudeau."
