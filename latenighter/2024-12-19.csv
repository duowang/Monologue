Seth Meyers,"[On CNN doing its own rooftop drone-based exposé] “Wait, you’re at a college program dedicated entirely to drones called the drone port in a state where people are seeing the drones, you just explained that CNN itself uses drones, you’re currently surrounded by drones, and you can’t figure out where the drones are coming from? This is like watching someone knocking over a beehive and then start screaming, ‘Help! Something is stinging me and I don’t know what!'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,And you can trust him because his PhD is in statin’ the f**kin’ obvious.
Seth Meyers,"Poor guy, he’s gotta sit there and walk through the pros and cons of shooting something out of the sky like it’s not the most obvious thing in the world. If I were him I’d be chugging a bottle of whiskey during this whole interview. ‘[Pouring whiskey] Well on one hand you could just ignore these incredibly common and widely available aircraft that so far have caused no harm and pose no threat to humans. [Chugging] On the other hand you could burn down the forest and your own house, kill someone and go to jail, so you know, it’s 50-50. Cheers, motherf**ker.'” seth meyers"
Seth Meyers,I know but I’m not telling
Seth Meyers,"Oh my God, in one clip, she managed to sound like a whole rack of supermarket tabloids. ‘Is it aliens? Is it Russian and China? Are Brad and Jen getting back together?'"
Seth Meyers,You think Russia and China lost a nuclear warhead and it’s in New Jersey? Did they lose it in a poker game in Atlantic City? Is that why Putin’s been walking up and down the beach with one of those metal detectors?
Seth Meyers,‘New Jersey and beyond’ sounds like the slogan of a deadbeat Buzz Lightyear.
Seth Meyers,"It’s just as the prophecy foretold, when the apocalypse comes it will start in New Jersey. ‘And I looked and I beheld a Pale Horse, and the name that sat on him was Tony, that lazy f**k, he was on the garden state parkway near exit 114 and he said, whoa, what’s wit’ all the friggin drones!!!'"
Seth Meyers,"All this clip proves is that drones are incredibly common and are used in virtually every aspect of modern life. Would it shock you if some dipsh*t started flying them at night to freak people out? Especially in New Jersey, a state whose motto is, ‘I’m Just Bustin’ Balls!'"
Stephen Colbert,We’ll have more on this story as it continues to be nothing.
Stephen Colbert,"Yes! Obviously the drones could be aliens, who are all famously obsessed with New Jersey. We know this—we all saw the scene from Close Encounters ."
Stephen Colbert,"You won! So now it’s election interference just to get a prediction wrong? Well in that case, Punxsutawney Phil, you better lawyer up, buttercup, if you ever want to see your shadow again."
Stephen Colbert,"leaking” and election interference] “It’s true! The Des Moines Register leaked its poll where you’d least expect it, in the Des Moines Register . Same way I leak my opinion every night at 11:30/10:30 Central, following your local news, sports, and weather leaks."
Stephen Colbert,"And if the president thinks he can bully the media into never saying anything bad about him, well… [Takes off glasses for emphasis] So what else is goin’ on?"
Stephen Colbert,Anyone have any money in the stock market? Not any more.
Stephen Colbert,"Today the Dow plunged over 1,100 points. And that is a lot of… Dow units? Dow-lings? Moist Dow-lettes."
Stephen Colbert,"Take South Carolina Republican and adult woman who gets her makeup done at the American Girl store, Nancy Mace."
Stephen Colbert,"Speaking of the sky, space. The sky’s dad."
Stephen Colbert,I’m guessing the games of I Spy are getting a little predictable. ‘I spy with my little eye…’ ‘Hatch. You spy a hatch. It’s always a hatch.'
Stephen Colbert,And what a holly jolly Christmas that’ll be. [Crooning] ‘I’m dreaming of a new poop-tube…'
Stephen Colbert,And I’m sure this comes as terrible news to all those Floridians whose New Year’s resolution is to watch more porn.
Stephen Colbert,"Meaning, in just two weeks, you will no longer get a pop-up."
Stephen Colbert,PornHub knows this is a slippery slope. They’re not set up to have your secure information. They have no interest in collecting your mom’s maiden name. They want your stepmom’s maiden name.
Stephen Colbert,"That’s so sad. You know what, I should throw them a goodbye party. I’ll go to… no!! I didn’t see that coming."
Jimmy Fallon,"Today, president-elect Trump hosted Jeff Bezos for a meeting at Mar-a-Lago. Unfortunately, right after Bezos was dropped off, someone stole him front the front porch."
Jimmy Fallon,"Uber just donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. Not to be outdone, Lyft just changed their pick mustaches to this."
Jimmy Fallon,Then she blew out her candles and her house exploded.
