Stephen Colbert,"In previous shutdowns, inspection of chemical and water treatment plants halted, as did routine food safety inspections. But you have nothing to worry about, unless you’re one of those rare people who needs food or water."
Stephen Colbert,"I’m sure the Founders are spinning in their graves with joy at the way all of this is playing out. After all, the Constitution does start with, ‘We the people do whatever rich boy tells us. Rich boy makes the big square truck car! LOL.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Woof. Well if he’s gonna be the guy running everything, I’m gonna have to have to work on my Elon Musk impression. Here goes: [awkward little stage-leap.]"
Stephen Colbert,"So Johnson might have to move on to a new job, and hopefully one that’s more pleasant than trying to wrangle the House Republican caucus. Like septic tank snorkeler."

Stephen Colbert,[Singing] It’s beginning to look a lot like horse skull.
Stephen Colbert,Now you may remember that Gaetz was nominated to be Attorney General before it came to light that he’s awful and everyone hates him. Also there’s that nitpick that he might be a sex criminal.

I can imagine him driving his golf cart on the thruway. I can imagine him performing oral sex on a microphone (since that’s a real thing he did). Still can’t believe that’s an American president and not an eighth-grader trying to get kicked off the debate team.” seth meyers"
