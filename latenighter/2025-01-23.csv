name,monologue
Ronny Chieng,‘New executive order… we are banning church.'
Ronny Chieng,"Hey Bishop, please. We don’t go to church to hear a lecture about having mercy on the less fortunate. That’s not what church is for!"
Ronny Chieng,"He was probably looking up at Jesus on the cross and being like, ‘Hey, you and me both, brother.'"
Ronny Chieng,murderers today are not even charged
Ronny Chieng,"Also think big picture here. If he lets these violent criminals go, there’s a chance they’ll kill the other violent criminals and then they’ll just cancel each other out."
Ronny Chieng,"F*ck it, release ’em all"
Ronny Chieng,"And look, you can’t expect someone to go through these cases one-by-one. I mean, the FBI did, and the prosecutors did, and the judges did, and the juries, and the paralegals, and the person who types on that weird little typewriter no one else knows how to use. But Trump is busy, okay? It’s much easier to go select-alt-delete."
Ronny Chieng,"No spoilers! Tommy Tuberville hasn’t watched Jan 6 yet, okay? He’ll get to it, but there’s just so much to watch these days. You know, he’s still got 9/11 and Benghazi on his DVR."
Ronny Chieng,"What do you mean you didn’t see the insurrection? You lived it! This is like a Titanic survivor saying, “I haven’t seen the movie, don’t tell me what happens.'"
Seth Meyers,"[On Trump idealizing the Gilded Age economy over the present day] “Is it possible that the United States of America was actually richer before cars were mass produced, before polio was cured, back when Coca-Cola still had actual cocaine in it? I mean that part I get, because people were probably way more productive. ‘Yeah, I’m gonna ride a horse down to the farm and then I’m gonna plant a bunch of corn and sh*t, then I’m gonna go to the factory and make a bunch o’ textiles. Put ’em on a railroad car, ride a horse down to the oil field, waaaa!!'"
Seth Meyers,"Do you really think America had more money before cell phones and computers existed? [Trump voice] ‘America used to be a rich nation but then came the cell phone and now everybody spends their money on extra lives in Candy Crush, and that’s why we have to place tariffs on the Jelly Queen and Cupcake Carl.'"
Seth Meyers,"It does answer the question, what do you get the man who has everything—the benefit of the doubt."
Seth Meyers,I don’t know why everyone was complaining. He’s just grabbing his heart and throwing it violently out to the crowd. In that classic gesture that has no dark historical overtones.
Seth Meyers,"I mean, who among us hasn’t seig-ed when we were trying to zag?"
Seth Meyers,"This is what we can expect for the next few years, an aging TV personality pretending to wrestle America’s enemies while, much like Hulk Hogan’s sleeves, he rips us off."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You would think, as people living in an area prone to wildfires, we’d get a bit more sympathy from an elf who lives in a hollowed-out tree."
Jimmy Kimmel,giant valve” that California could have turned to put out the fires] “Such a good question. How could we forget about our giant super-sink?
Jimmy Kimmel,"Anyway, I am outraged by the cost of eggs."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The mass deportations Trump promised are underway. Large-scale raids on undocumented immigrants started today, which means Melania is hiding in her bedroom for two reasons now."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump says the only thing that matters when hiring people are aptitude and qualifications. ‘Now please confirm this blackout drunk I pulled off Fox News for Secretary of Defense, okay?'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"The code was, ‘This man should never be Defense Secretary of the United States.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"This has to be God punishing us for pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord. It snowed in Georgia, Alabama, Texas. Senator Ted Cruz is requesting an extra blanket on his United flight to Cabo as we speak."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Someone suggested I watch Instagram Reels instead? Yeah, no, I stabbed them."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, Reels is exactly the same. And Nicorette gum tastes exactly like cigarettes, shut up. You sound like an idiot."
Taylor Tomlinson,"The U.S. government claims TikTok should be banned because it steals our data, which is unacceptable, I guess. ‘Cause they’re like, “Hey, that’s Mark’s thing.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,Why is Trump freeing TikTok? TikTok didn’t storm the Capitol.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Trump was part of the original movement to ban TikTok and now he’s the one letting us keep it. So it kind of feels like someone kidnapped my child and then was like, ‘Hey, I found your baby!'"
Jimmy Fallon,"It was so cold out there today, all the January 6 rioters stormed a Burlington Coat Factory."
Jimmy Fallon,"They were like, ‘This isn’t the thoughtful, measured Trump we remembered from the first term.'"
Jimmy Fallon,At this point the only prisoner Trump hasn’t released is Melania.
Jimmy Fallon,"A spokesman for the network said, ‘Thanks to the January 6 pardons, we’ll have at least 1,600 viewers.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Meanwhile, Gen Z is like, ‘What is being revived on what?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Not only will Trump sanction Russia, he’s also threatening to take full custody of Kim Jong Un."
Jimmy Fallon,"When Trump threatened him, Putin was like, ‘Ever since you’ve started hanging out with Elon, you’ve like totally changed.'"
Stephen Colbert,That snow is going to really change the vibe of throwing beads at Mardi Gras. ‘Show me your layers!'
Stephen Colbert,New Orleans hasn’t seen that much powder since anyone took a bite from a beignet.
Stephen Colbert,"Two out of 10! If you want an idea of how unpopular that is, that’s only one point higher than the Rotten Tomatoes score for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen ."
Stephen Colbert,not my place” to second-guess Trump] “Not your place? They attacked the House of Representatives! That is literally your place.
Stephen Colbert,"[On Senator Tommy Tuberville claiming he hadn’t seen the videos of the insurrection] “Well, I guess if he hasn’t seen anything, it didn’t exist. In which case, Senator…"
Stephen Colbert,"F*ck it, release ’em all"
Stephen Colbert,"You know what, if you really want to get them in there, tell them they’re not invited. They’ll find a way."
Stephen Colbert,"Yes! Hell yeah, no. Let’s send her back to the hellhole she came from—New Jersey."
Stephen Colbert,"wasn’t too exciting”] “Yeah, dog, it’s church! The most exciting thing happens is sometimes they ring a little bell."
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, now that seems inappropriate, but maybe he was just being patriotic. You know, throwing little portraits of George Washington onto the stage."
Stephen Colbert,"[On reports of a drunken Hegseth vomiting and/or blacking out in multiple locations] “Evidently there is no place that Pete Hegseth hasn’t passed out. You can read all about it in the new children’s classic, Oh, the Places You’ll Go Unconscious! "
