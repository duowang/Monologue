Seth Meyers,"Okay there’s to much to get into here, so we’ll just have to ignore the fact that Trump thinks that trees can just melt into the ground. I think he saw that Salvador Dali Painting, thought that was the news."
Seth Meyers,"‘Some people thought that some were unfair or some were not doing their job.’ He can’t even explain his own decisions without sounding like he’s doing a book report for a book he hasn’t read. ‘ The Giving Tree , of course, is about a tree that gives.'"
Seth Meyers,"‘Yeah, he broke the law but what do you expect him to do? He’s a charismatic outlaw bandit who is on the run from the sheriff, and we’re gonna rob a freight train together like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid!'"
Jon Stewart,"For some reason, we have given presidents the power of a king. And then we say, ‘Oh by the way, that power, you’re not going to get all kingly and sh*t on us, right?'"
Jon Stewart,"See how easy that was? It was a dictatorship and then a judge went, ‘Mnnn…’ [wags finger, shakes head.]'"
Jon Stewart,"It’s like when you have an electric fence. You never check it, you’re not really sure if it works. ‘Cause you have a good boy. You have a very good boy. But then one day… zap."
Jon Stewart,‘How do you know me?’ ‘You’ve been in one thing! How do you know I’m Dr. Phil? Because you’re on the Dr. Phil Show . ‘
Jon Stewart,What the f*ck? He’s so emboldened he wants to start deporting people from other people’s countries!
Jon Stewart,"Who names an A.I. company after the thing it actually does? Where are your random letters? Where are your GPT, your Grok? DeepSeek sounds like what you might use it for. China’s even beating us at naming sh*t."
Jon Stewart,"I know this is bad financially, but is anyone else excited that A.I. had its job replaced by A.I.?"
Stephen Colbert,Daddy Donny is keeping his promise to round up immigrants in order to save the dogs that weren’t being eaten by imaginary Mexican Hannibal Lecter.
Stephen Colbert,"blitz”] “Blitz? Really? Short for blitzkrieg? Just once can we do some fun German stuff? I’d love to see a headline that said, ‘Trump Administration Launches Nationwide Strudel.'"

Stephen Colbert,"Yeah, but maybe Trump is getting rid of all the oversight so nobody sees him doing anything good?"
Stephen Colbert,"Don’t worry, Mr. Secretary, they’re not booing. They’re saying, ‘Pete has a problem with booooooooze.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Well thanks, Mitch. [Dusts hands] Republic saved. Sure, you may have personally blocked the impeachment of Trump in 2021, but history will remember you as the guy who almost stopped Pete Hegseth. It’ll all be in the book, Profiles in Uhhhhh ."
Jimmy Kimmel,"On Saturday, Pete Hegseth was sworn in to Trump’s liquor cabinet on a stack of Mike’s Hard Lemonade."
Jimmy Kimmel,"One of Trump’s primary messages during the campaign was that immigrants were eating our pets. So what does he do, he goes out and hires the woman who shot all the pets. Problem solved. Homeland secured."
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s right, he will be issuing an executive order making the whole state a Six Flags Hurricane Harbor."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The governor did his best to make nice. He said, in front of reporters, to the president he said, ‘You were there for us during Covid and we won’t forget it.’ Which is like telling Michael Meyers he was there for us Halloween and we won’t forget it."
Jimmy Kimmel,A lot of ‘stud’s. He may want to throw a couple of ‘hunks’ or ‘beefcakes’ in there.
Jimmy Kimmel,Taylor Swift has now been to more Super Bowls than the New York Jets.

Taylor Tomlinson,I have some of my own cancel culture insurance. It’s called shutting the f*ck up.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Listen up, CEOs, this is very short-sighted. If you don’t hire Gen Z, who are you going to cheat on your spouse with?"
Taylor Tomlinson,"We’ve all lied in job interviews before, but now Gen Z has to be like, ‘Yeah, no, I also don’t need to sleep or use the bathroom.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah that’s right, some guy is going to have to go home and tell his wife that he blew their kid’s college fund because Taylor didn’t wear a ponytail like he thought."
Jimmy Fallon,"If you’re rooting for the Eagles, you’re probably from Philly. And if you’re rooting for the Chiefs, you’re probably an NFL referee."
Jimmy Fallon,"Right now fans are asking themselves, ‘Should I buy two Super Bowl tickets or a dozen eggs?'"

Jimmy Fallon,That looks like what you see outside of Satan’s corporate headquarters.
Jimmy Fallon,"That story again, A.I. is afraid of losing its job to A.I."
