Stephen Colbert,"special project”] “Going after honest civil servants just doing their job is not a special project, it is a disgrace. A special project is when, to protect you from the bullies on the playground, instead of going to recess you get to help Miss Brogden clean the erasers.

Stephen Colbert,"[Trump voice]’Oh, they’re all gonna be fine folks, don’t you worry about it. I have a lot of experience in non-profits. In fact, all my casinos did non make a profit.'"

I need a medic over here—we gotta get this guy a labia, stat!'"

Jimmy Kimmel,"During the campaign, Trump promised to build an impenetrable dome over the country, similar to the one he tries to hide with the Aqua-Net and the propecia every day."

Taylor Tomlinson,"Seriously though, did you think these billionaire tech guys got so rich by asking for the exact amount they needed and not a penny more? They’re like toddlers. Have you ever seen a toddler be like, ‘Actually, that’s the final push I needed on the swing. Let’s go home, I don’t want to overdo it.'"
