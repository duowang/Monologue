Seth Meyers,"You know I had very low expectations for what Donald Trump’s first week in office would be like. But even I did not think that he would, you know, turn the government off."
Seth Meyers,"Yeah, no more money for transgenderism and wokeness at the [checks list] Phoenix Fire Department, which was slated to lose 35 million dollars under the freeze. I’m so tired of all these woke firefighters coming to my house and refusing to put out the fire because they’re too busy tantalizing us with their hot shirtless calendars."
Seth Meyers,"By the way, if you’re ever wondering if a plan is evil, the word ‘seize’ is a dead giveaway. You’ll never hear a politician say, ‘We should seize tax dollars to give kids some free school lunches.'"
Seth Meyers,Did you though? Did you get that? Because it seems like you want kids that live in cities to—let me check my notes here—pick berries?
Seth Meyers,"sluggish” response to the crisis] “Let’s go, Democrats, this is your moment to grab the national spotlight. Avengers assemble! [News report stating Democrats will have a virtual meeting about the issue the day after the freeze was announced] Sorry, the Avengers can’t assemble until tomorrow?"
Seth Meyers,"aroused”] “Move over, Phoenix firefighter calendar, because somebody just landed January in the Hunks of the Senate ."
Seth Meyers,"I have never, in my life, been less aroused than hearing Chuck Schumer say the word aroused. It’s like hearing your grandpa say, ‘These pancakes are moist.’ [Shuddering] Ugh."
Michael Kosta,"Today was a big day for Donald Trump’s cabinet. The government one, not the one with golf trophies he gave himself."
Michael Kosta,"And look, we all remember the stories about this guy from the campaign. The dead bear cub he dumped in Central Park, the time he sawed off the head of a dead whale and tied it to the roof of his car, the worm that died after eating part of his brain. Basically, if there’s an animal corpse anywhere in America, RFK Jr is probably involved."
Michael Kosta,"a predator” and noting how he used to put baby chickens and mice in a blender to feed his pet birds in college] “He was putting baby chickens and mice in a blender? And ladies, you thought it was bad when a guy brought you back to his dorm room and busted out a guitar."
Michael Kosta,"We all have a crazy cousin. It’s the cousin rule of three. There’s the crazy one, a quiet one, and one that we secretly think is hot. What’s up, Stephanie?"
Michael Kosta,"Whoa, 15,000 doctors signed this letter. Of course, we don’t know who they are because they all just signed it like this [scribbling motion.]"
Michael Kosta,That is the worst answer to ‘What would you do with a time machine?’ that I have ever heard. You can’t think of anyone else in your family that you would go back in time and try to prevent a shot from happening?
Michael Kosta,"Jesus Christ, this guy has said so many thing that he can’t remember if he said ‘Black AIDS is different than white AIDS?’ [RFK voice] ‘White AIDS is so bland. And they put raisins in it. Don’t bring that white AIDS to my cookout.'"
Michael Kosta,"Un-vaxxed, Unafraid” baby onesies sold from his website] “Wow, I never realized how much I would enjoy watching Bernie Sanders talking about baby clothes. [Bernie voice] ‘And these little corduroy dungarees, why do they have pockets? A baby doesn’t need to carry around a wallet or car keys! Do you support that?'"
Stephen Colbert,"We’ve all seen the classic Jimmy Stewart movie, Mr. Smith Says Covid Was Genetically Engineered to Spare Jews and Still Gets to Go to Washington ."
Stephen Colbert,"So get ready for a soup-based healthcare system. ‘Uh, Mr. Reynolds, I have your chart here. We have your EKG results and I’m afraid we need to start treatment immediately. Luckily, you insurance covers gazpacho.'"
Stephen Colbert,"If you’re alarmed about RFK Jr becoming our health secretary, there’s a good chance you may be a member of his family."
Stephen Colbert,"Ooooh, I love an old fashioned Kennedy fight. Usually these things get worked out in Nantucket with croquet mallets until it’s time for oysters, gin, and the NDAs."
Stephen Colbert,"a predator”] “Uh, you’re not a predator if the animal you’re eating was already run over by a Volvo. Technically you’re a scavenger."
Stephen Colbert,chicks and mice in a blender
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, he has the courage to ask uncomfortable questions all the time. Like, ‘Are you gonna finish that raccoon?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Well, to quote Shakespeare, ‘You can’t just say you’re quoting someone and then make up whatever you want, ya numbnuts.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, it’s the most unhelpful child’s product to hit the market since Hasbro released My Little Polio."
Jimmy Kimmel,"And guess what, not one of the 27 senators on the finance committee asked him about it today. Not one. We’ve reached a point where these cabinet picks are so nutty, the idea that one of them was making Stuart Little smoothies doesn’t even come up."
Jimmy Kimmel,‘Are you supportive of these onesies? And what is your position on binkies?'
Jimmy Kimmel,We could have a Health and Human Services Secretary who puts Easter animals in a blender paired up with a head of Homeland Security who shoots puppies and goats. This is quite a farm Old MacDonald has put together for us.
Jimmy Kimmel,"And if there’s anybody you can trust to honor a deal, it’s Donald J. Trump. He’ll probably pay them in Melania meme-coin or something."
Jimmy Kimmel,"sending $50 million in condoms to Hamas “] “I’ve gotta say, whoever is writing his lies for him this time deserves a raise. They are hilarious."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Imagine asking a Native American, ‘Are you here illegally?’ ‘No you’re here illegally! You’ve been here illegally for 500 years.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Well, there’s lots of horrible stuff happening in the world. That’s just how I greet people now."
Taylor Tomlinson,"[After a TikTok video exhorting people to give in and enjoy like there’s no tomorrow] “That’s what positivity is now: ‘Who the f*ck cares?’ I love this. Let’s indulge. I have been eating fistfuls of peanut butter and shoplifting from Home Depot. I don’t even need anything from Home Depot and now I have, like, nine buckets."
Taylor Tomlinson,"That’s so cool! I love that. But it does pose the question, who have I been sending my nudes to?"
Taylor Tomlinson,Good luck enforcing this. Those people love getting handcuffed.
Taylor Tomlinson,"You really can’t take our reality show titles seriously. There are no sharks on Shark Tank , there’s no love on Love Island , there are no stars on Dancing With the Stars ."
Jimmy Fallon,"According to the Chinese calendar, it’s the Year of the Snake. Although according to some Republicans, it’s the year 1952."
Jimmy Fallon,Trump is threatening to fire anyone who doesn’t come back into the office. Instead he wants them to come back into the office so he can fire them in person.
Jimmy Fallon,Yesterday he froze all federal aid then today he unfroze it. It’s like Trump is being advised by the giant doll from Squid Game .
Jimmy Fallon,"Wegman’s has recalled chicken nuggets after bone fragments were found in the meat. Yeah, when they found bones in the chicken, they just flipped the sign from ‘nuggets’ to ‘wings’ and called it a day."
