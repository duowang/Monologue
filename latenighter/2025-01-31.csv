Michael Kosta,"I get a little bit nervous when Trump has a strong opinion. You know, it’s never something unifying, like ‘Sunsets are beautiful,’ or ‘Love is the answer.'"
Michael Kosta,So let’s spin the big wheel of blame to see which minorities are responsible for this crash. Who will it be this time? Black people? Lesbians? Trans Armenians?
Michael Kosta,"Damn you, diversity initiatives! Why are you responsible for every historical tragedy? The fires in Los Angeles—DEI. The bridge collapse in Baltimore—DEI. The Irish potato famine—DEI. Slavery—DEI. Did you ever notice how many minorities were at slavery? It’s all DEI."
Michael Kosta,"common sense” talking] “There you go, he has common sense! It’s just a coincidence that his common sense happens to align with his long-held prejudices."
Michael Kosta,Dwarfism. I can’t believe it’s only Day 10 and Trump’s already this far down his list of scapegoats. He’s blown past race and gender and now he’s hitting… dwarves?
Michael Kosta,"You’re blaming Obama? The guy from three presidents ago? Forget blaming a fart on your dog, this is blaming a fart on your dog that died when you were eight."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Remember when he waited 10 minutes after the wildfires started here in L.A. before he started blaming DEI? Well I guess he learned from that lesson, because now he slept on it and then started pointing that little orange nub."
Jimmy Kimmel,"common sense” tells him diversity is to blame] “Take it from a man who looked directly into an eclipse, you need common sense."
Jimmy Kimmel,"If a straight, white, male pilot had injected a little bleach into that helicopter, none of this would have happened."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He hears the word Blackhawk and he’s like, ‘Well, if that hawk had been white…'"
Jimmy Kimmel,Blaming this on DEI is like blaming 9/11 on hummus.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I think maybe he gets jealous when a disaster gets more coverage than him. He’s like, ‘I’m the biggest disaster, point that camera at me right now.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Maybe after four years in the wilderness, the humiliation of a failed coup, and the criminal convictions, maybe this time we’ll see another side of him. Turns out there is no other side. He’s two-dimensional. He’s fascist Flat Stanley."
Stephen Colbert,"The horrific fires sweeping through Los Angeles? DEI in the fire department. Violence in America? DEI in the police departments. Grocery prices? DEI chickens. ‘Folks, I don’t understand why all of a sudden we have all these brown eggs, when did that start?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Okay to all of his supporters who said, ‘He’s not gonna build camps!,’ you’re right, he’s not. He’s refurbishing camps."
Stephen Colbert,TV camera-ready”] “Unfortunately they didn’t say what kind of TV and one agent arrived at the raid dressed as the Masked Singer pineapple.
Stephen Colbert,"‘[Trump voice]Yeah but children can be so vicious, folks. Just a few months ago they were all going door-to-door, demanding candy. Some were vampires, some were cowboys with little guns. I saw one wicked witch and her little brother was a dinosaur."
Stephen Colbert,"Hey, ICE dummies, some Americans can speak other languages. For instance, I took seven years of Latin, are you going to deport me to ancient Rome?"
Stephen Colbert,I’m sorry” to Puerto Rican-born Americans] “He would have said ‘Lo siento’ but then he would have had to deport himself.
Seth Meyers,"‘Wicked and pernicious purposes?’ You’re really living up to your Wormtongue reputation, aren’t you? ‘Banish this foul wizard from thy hall, my liege. He presents himself for wicked and pernicious purposes!'"
Seth Meyers,"Trump’s closest and most influential adviser is not a union leader or a member of the working class, it’s a guy worth $400 billion who somehow looks like he’s skydiving even when he’s standing still."
Seth Meyers,He looks like a dollar store rip-off of a Michael Myers mask.
Seth Meyers,"People who got addicted to nicotine because of a Big Tobacco coverup still deserve healthcare as a human right. And I would think you of all people would get that, since you look like you’ve been smoking cigarettes for like a hundred years."
Seth Meyers,I mean look at this guy. He’s the same color as the ceiling tiles in the teacher’s lounge.
Taylor Tomlinson,"And I know you’re seeing that poster and you’re thinking, ‘Why is he a monkey?’ Just trust me, you get used to him being a monkey so quickly. It’s like watching a movie with Dennis Quaid in it—you forget he’s a Republican and you’re just having fun."
Taylor Tomlinson,You’re telling me you don’t want to see a monkey snort cocaine? You never get to see that! Unless you work at a zoo in Florida.
Taylor Tomlinson,I’m so upset that this movie didn’t make money. And not only because I know it’s going to be so much harder to sell my biopic where young Taylor is played by a falcon.
Taylor Tomlinson,"It’s true, okay? If a coked-out dude yelled at me, I’d be like, ‘Okay, time to run away.’ But if a koala did it I’d probably be like, ‘Aw, he probably has demons.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"The premise of this film may sound weird at first, but I promise you it works. Like pineapple on pizza, or tomato juice on a plane, or a TV show about the internet during the fall of democracy."
Jimmy Fallon,"If you’re unfamiliar with Dog Man , it’s a spinoff from Captain Underpants . If you’re unfamiliar with Captain Underpants , it’s a spinoff from Jane Austen’s Sense & Sensibility ."
Jimmy Fallon,"Dog Man is about a police officer and a police dog who get hurt and, to save them, they have to be fused together. Sounds crazy but that’ll be a common surgery under RFK Jr."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah half-man, half-dog. When they heard, Arby’s was like, ‘Crap, they’re onto us.'"
Jimmy Fallon,I guess it’s possible Travis proposes to Taylor but there’s a better chance of a referee proposing to Patrick Mahomes.
Jimmy Fallon,"Yep, he’s sleeping in a place that’s near Trump but separate. Or as it’s known, pulling a Melania."
