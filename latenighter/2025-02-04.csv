Jon Stewart,LGBT” being cut to just “LGB
Jon Stewart,"Aw yeah, consonants and pronouns. You’re next, prepositions!"
Jon Stewart,"Denmark, Panama, Greenland! The Axis of Where Are Those?"

Jon Stewart,Mexico I get. Trump’s been hate-f*cking Mexico pretty much since the escalator.
Jon Stewart,We’re picking a fight with our most reliable and pleasant friend? The labradoodle of allies?

Jon Stewart,Let that be a lesson to the world—we are a terrible friend.
Jon Stewart,"‘Mexico, you send a few troops to the border. But Canada, if you could, I don’t know, cease to exist as an independent entity, fair?'"

Jon Stewart,"Yes, merit and merit alone, says RNC chairwoman Lara—hold on, let me get my glasses—Trump."
Jon Stewart,"That’s the irony of this whole thing. The people standing next to Trump on that terrible night, blaming DEI, and trying to reinstall white guys as the only non-suspect pool of hires are themselves DEI hires for one particular identity that they possess—the ass-kisser."
Stephen Colbert,"Anyone who’s ever had a toddler knows this feeling. You leave the room for one second, and when you come back everything from the bookshelves is on the floor, the walls are covered in ketchup, and when you ask who gave the dog a haircut with safety scissors, your kid says, ‘It was DEI.'"

Stephen Colbert,They’re our largest foreign supplier of crude oil. Also our largest supplier of polite oil.
Stephen Colbert,So he’s lashing out at Canada for no damn reason. What will this do to the longest continuous peaceful border in the world. How will this affect our cooperation with a vital NATO ally? What will this do to our relationship with our imaginary girlfriend from camp? Her name’s Mackenzie and she’s a model.
Stephen Colbert,"Canadians are booing us. Even worse, then they have to boo us again in French."
Stephen Colbert,"That’s right, ladies and gentlemen. Turn your clocks to 1913. Tariffs are back and so is scarlet fever. But at least the President of the United States is gonna get stuck in a bathtub. [Prayer hands] Please."
Stephen Colbert,"What are tariffs?”] “They don’t even know what they voted for! The next three most popular searches were, ‘What my Trump hat say?,’ ‘Is Mexico America?,’ and ‘Can get pregnant in hot tub if keep jeans on?'"

Taylor Tomlinson,"I don’t know much about the stock market, but I’m pretty sure this graph is the money equivalent of a sad trombone noise."
Taylor Tomlinson,"This is a classic Trump strategy. He loves to cause problems and then look like a hero when he makes them go away. Still waiting for our 30-day pause on Eric, by the way."
Jimmy Fallon,"People are wondering why Trump would start a trade war with our closest allies and Trump was like, ‘I didn’t say anything about Russia and North Korea.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Maybe it’s the New Yorker in me but the last people you want to upset are your upstairs and downstairs neighbors.
Jimmy Fallon,"WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!)"
