Desi Lydic,"tremendous fat” we have in government] [Biting knuckles] “Ohhh, don’t take the bait, Desi. Be the bigger person, be the bigger person…"
Desi Lydic,"That’s right, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and guy who cheers in the wrong parts of Saving Private Ryan ."
Desi Lydic,"Yes, the richest man in the world is cutting off aid to poor countries. Why can’t you just be a normal billionaire and co-host Shark Tank or run an NBA team into the ground?"
Desi Lydic,"Did we really have to learn all about this guy’s sex life just so he could get to a common expression? ‘I can only climax when someone steps on my balls. Anyway, there’s no use cryin’ over spilled milk.'"
Desi Lydic,What the f*ck? These agents were doing their job and enforcing the law and now they’re getting fired? That is not how it works. I cannot believe I have to explain firing to the star of The Apprentice . That was your whole fake job.
Stephen Colbert,"A very sad, very lonely little boy who had all the money in the world yet could not buy a single droplet of cool."
Stephen Colbert,Elon was able to buy his way into our government. And now he’s blowing it up like a Tesla in self-driving mode.
Stephen Colbert,"Elon, you could be the next Dyson! You never stop sucking."
Stephen Colbert,"So they should be unstoppable, as long as their mission does not involve renting a car."
Stephen Colbert,"Ah yes, famously accurate A.I. The cutting edge technology that told Google users to ‘eat at least one small rock per day.’ Now I know on the surface that sounds dumb, but a rock is the only way to defeat the scissors that A.I. told you to swallow first."
Stephen Colbert,"bellyaching”] “Yeah, everybody knows you can fudge the Constitution a little bit. That’s why at the very end it says, ‘Or not!’ [With smiling hands-up emoji.]"
Stephen Colbert,I’ve been eating at the wrong diner.
Seth Meyers,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced yesterday that President Trump’s proposed tariffs on imports from Canada have been paused for a month in exchange for implementing a 1.3 billion dollar border plan and appointing a fentanyl czar, both of which are things they were doing anyway. So it’s like NBC telling me they’re going to cancel my show unless I do three Closer Looks a week and dress like a dad on a camping trip."
Seth Meyers,President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum reached a deal yesterday to pause U.S.-Mexico tariffs for a month after she finally backed down and agreed to explain to him how tariffs work. [Trump voice] ‘Oh so we pay that? Well that’s not good.'
Seth Meyers,"That’s right, President Trump last night agreed to a month-long pause on his plans for Canadian and Mexican goods. So we can all breathe a sigh of relief, unless he’s overruled by the actual president."
Seth Meyers,"WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT) regarding his tariff plan] “Not for nothin’, but those were also his vows, so…"
Seth Meyers,Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene sent letters yesterday to top leaders at PBS and requested they testify before her committee. Also that they explain this relationship.
Seth Meyers,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis proposed a new holiday yesterday called Second Amendment Summer that would remove sales tax on firearms and ammunition between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. Is that a good idea, though? Making weapons easier to get right when Florida is at its most humid?"
Jimmy Kimmel,Next his plan is to force France to give us the Statue of Liberty.
Jimmy Kimmel,"There are 41 million people living in Canada. There are about the same number we have living in California. California has 54 electoral votes. If Canada also had 54 electoral votes, forget MAGA, our next president will be a kind-hearted lesbian moose."
Jimmy Kimmel,"After Kennedy got through, the Republicans who voted for him broke into a rousing chorus of ‘For He’s a Jolly Rubella.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"That seems fine, right? Trump probably wants to make sure they get a nice Christmas bonus or something."
Jimmy Kimmel,Eliminating the Department of Education isn’t making America great again. It’s making America Florida.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Okay, last week it was 50, now it’s 100. How did it go to a hundred in five days? Did Diddy join Hamas?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"[On the skyrocketing price of eggs] “This is gonna be a tough Easter, kids. Get ready to start hunting Swedish meatballs. "
Taylor Tomlinson,"revenge quitting,” where you leave your job suddenly and without notice] “Okay, so quitting. Young people can’t do anything without the media branding it as some new toxic trend. There’s revenge quitting, quiet quitting. If Gen Z dies on the job, Boomers will be like, ‘Okay another lazy life quitter.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"And yeah, this is annoying. How dare you make me jealous of rats. They get free birth control, they can tolerate lactose. Next you’re gonna tell me they’re giving squirrels free dental, this is bullsh*t."
Taylor Tomlinson,"I hear the city’s message loud and clear. If we want free birth control, women have to start being pests. Chew through the drywall, spread disease, take a sh*t in the fridge."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Do you think accountants watch this and were like, ‘Hey, I f*ck.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,Pharmacists being on the list doesn’t surprise me either. They won’t cheat on you because everyone they meet at work is gross.
Taylor Tomlinson,"I mean farmers, big surprise. The guy who doesn’t cheat goes to bed at 6 pm and smells like cow sh*t."
Taylor Tomlinson,Now that is a rat that needs birth control.
Jimmy Fallon,"That story again, nobody invited Trump to their Super Bowl party."
Jimmy Fallon,That’s nice. He decided not to break up with them until after Valentine’s Day.
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump also announced that the tariffs on China are still in effect, which means the price of clothing will rise. It’s a big deal to everyone except Kanye’s wife."
Jimmy Fallon,It’s just like he won fourth grade class president. ‘No more homework and pizza for lunch every day.'
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, I’m glad we’re saving money on the Department of Education so we can spend it on trick shot videos."
Jimmy Fallon,RFK Jr has a good shot to be our new health secretary. And that’s pretty much the only shot he has.
Jimmy Fallon,"He also said, ‘Why does everyone keep laughing when I say that?'"
