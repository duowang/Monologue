Seth Meyers,"‘Oh boy do I have egg on my face, and that’s a problem because egg prices are through the f*ckin’ roof. Someone should do something about that, but first—Gaza Beach!'"
Seth Meyers,"It’s the same old trap we’re always in, of not knowing if this is a real idea or this is just Trump distracting us while [picture of Elon Musk] Casper the Very Unfriendly Ghost dismantles the federal government."
Seth Meyers,looks like a demolition site right now
Seth Meyers,"So let me see if I understand this. The guy who’s famously anti-immigration wants Egypt and Jordan to take in millions of refugees. ‘I was on the phone with Egypt and Jordan and I told them, if there’s one thing I’ve always believed, it’s the more the merrier. Build bridges, not walls, I say.'"
Seth Meyers,It makes sense he likes this plan. The guy’s been dressed for the beach for 30 years. Looks like a cashier at a vape store on the boardwalk.
Seth Meyers,"It’s an insane and unworkable idea that would be a massive violation of human rights, cause outrage around the world, and entangle the U.S. in exactly the kind of foreign quagmire he promised to keep us out of and you’re reacting to it like someone at the Carhart store just told you there’s a sale on hoodies and cargo shorts."
Desi Lydic,Trump is going to turn Gaza into the Riviera? He couldn’t turn Atlantic City into a nicer Atlantic City.
Desi Lydic,"If anything, they tore down so many of his casinos, they turned Atlantic City into Gaza."
Desi Lydic,"Okay, just so I’m clear. Your plan is to take over Gaza, turn it into Mar-a-Lago, and make sure that the Palestinians who live there can’t go back? That is the craziest thing he’s said since yesterday and until tomorrow."
Desi Lydic,Look at her face. She looks like she just won Best Country Album at the Grammys.
Desi Lydic,"No, they usually scratch their heads and say, ‘What the f*ck are you talking about?'"
Desi Lydic,There’s a couple of kinks in that Slinky
Desi Lydic,"Of course America would never invade another country. You can read all about it in Steve Doocy’s American history book, Me Just Got Lobotomy by Steve Doocy."
Stephen Colbert,"own” the newly cleansed Gaza] “Oh, great idea. All these years, I don’t know why no one thought to call shotgun on the Holy Land."
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, the Riviera of the Middle East. The Cancun of crises. The Sandals of sadness. The Carnival cruise of war crime."
Stephen Colbert,That’s the face of a woman hoping she gets bumped up to first class on the flight to Nuremberg.
Stephen Colbert,"The beautiful, deep orange plumage with a touch of pale white around the eyes. Why would Don Jr have such hostile feelings about that duck?"
Stephen Colbert,"Ah, I miss the 1970’s. Back when the Happy Meal was four lead paint chips and a packet of Lucky Strikes."
Jimmy Kimmel,It’s like our country’s being run by the maniac from Saw . Donald Jigsaw Trump is running this.
Jimmy Kimmel,"the world’s people” would displace the 2 million Palestinians] “‘The world’s people.’ Maybe The Village People, I don’t know. You can see he’s really thought this through."
Jimmy Kimmel,He seems to think that the reason there’s conflict in Gaza is that nobody thought to give them a pickleball court.
Jimmy Kimmel,The only thing the United Nations and the Taliban have in common is they both think this is a terrible idea.
Jimmy Kimmel,That is the face of the woman whose soul just exited her body at the speed of light.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Our big story tonight, unfortunately: Elon Musk has done it again. [Picture of Musk doing a Hitler salute at Trump’s inauguration] No, not that. I mean, he probably has, in private."
Taylor Tomlinson,"The president signed an executive order giving Elon the power to make the government more ‘efficient.’ Which is like saying, ‘Why sleep when it’s more efficient to do cocaine?'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"read-only” access to Americans’ personal information] “This would be like if your nudes got leaked and everybody was like, ‘Don’t worry, people are just looking at them.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,Call me crazy but I don’t love the idea of handing the government over to guys who are still on their parents’ health insurance.
Taylor Tomlinson,I guess the only bright side here is that he will probably only steal Social Security numbers that end in 420 and 69.
Taylor Tomlinson,Have you ever seen a more Joffrey looking motherf*cker in your life? He looks like if Jimmy Neutron joined the Hitler Youth.
Taylor Tomlinson,"This guy looks like if the phrase, ‘Do You know who my father is?,’ gained sentience."
Taylor Tomlinson,Imagine working decades in public service distributing humanitarian aid and then having to defend your job to a kid who just discovered the show Family Guy .
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump wants to take over Greenland, Canada, and now the Gaza Strip. He’s like everyone at 2 a.m. drunk ordering off Amazon."
Jimmy Fallon,"A source close the president said it was Trump’s own idea. Everyone was like, ‘Oh yeah, we can tell.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Good luck with that. There’s a better chance of, uh, turning Gaza into the Riviera of the Middle East."
Jimmy Fallon,At this point Trump’s just one impeachment away from getting a free sandwich at the White House cafeteria.
Jimmy Fallon,"Due to the rising cost of eggs, more Americans are now investing in backyard chickens. People really want eggs. Today I saw a New Yorker squeezing a pigeon like a ketchup bottle."
Jimmy Fallon,Right now the suspects are considered armed and cage-free.
