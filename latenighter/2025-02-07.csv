Seth Meyers,Our aviation system! So now our planes will be controlled by a guy who can’t even get himself off the f*ckin’ ground?
Seth Meyers,"[On Musk explaining his plan to cut essentially all regulations and then add back the few we end up actually needing] “Yeah, totally. We just get rid of all regulations by default and if it turns out there’s some crazy reason we couldn’t possibly have anticipated for why we needed, I don’t know, food safety inspections, or federal approval of pharmaceuticals, or aviation guidelines, or clean water regulations, or baby formula testing, or rules against dumping toxic waste into rivers and making the fish glow like Mr. Burns, we just say, ‘Oops, my bad,’ and put them back in."
Seth Meyers,"I’d be so embarrassed if I were a senator and I couldn’t enter a building based on something called DOGE, which as a reminder, started as a meme about a Shiba Inu. That would be like yelling,’ I demand entry,’ and having an iced tea-sipping Kermit tell you, ‘But that’s none of my business.'"
Seth Meyers,"Imagine being a career civil servant and having to justify your job to a 19-year-old. It’s the government, not a Chipotle."
Desi Lydic,"own” the Gaza Strip] “Awww, Trump’s press secretary just had her first walk-back. This is an important rite of passage for Trump spokespeople. Their bull mitzvah, if you will."
Desi Lydic,"A backtrack and a double-down. [Olympic announcer voice] ‘And now, on the uneven bars, Donald Trump will attempt the rare combination backtrack/double-down. And let’s see if he breaks every bone in his body.'"
Desi Lydic,"But while his team attempts to fix his Gaza plan, Trump has already moved on. Because he’s basically the Norovirus. Every day he spews executive orders all over the place and while we struggle to clean up all the puke, he comes out the other end with something even worse."
Desi Lydic,"You notice how he paused just before ‘ invade your locker rooms ?’ Like, ‘Maybe we won’t make that illegal. Should have proofread this.'"
Desi Lydic,"It’s bad enough that he’s banned trans women from sports, but spare us the performance of pretending that this is a top issue for women in this country. Maybe start with, I don’t know, reproductive rights, or pay inequality, or why it’s 2025 and still, none of my clothes have pockets."
Stephen Colbert,"Oh yeah, everybody knows the weather is full of DEI, okay? Snowflakes are girls, tornadoes are boys, and sleet is bisexual. Is it rain? Is it snow? It could go both ways."
Stephen Colbert,"But under the reign of Elon’s pubescent net rangers, tornado warnings are gonna be a little different. ‘Hey kids! Kids, get in the house. The government just sent me a meme that says, ‘skibidi basement?’"
Stephen Colbert,big news” that Musk is setting his sights on the FAA’s flight safety software] “I’ve also got big news. I just bought an Amtrak rail pass.
Stephen Colbert,"Great! Because when I think of Elon Musk, I think air safety."
Stephen Colbert,"Well this can mean only one thing—the birds are having sex with the cows. Please, please… no one tell the bees."
Stephen Colbert,smarter than all of us
Stephen Colbert,"This year the matchup is Kansas City Chiefs, who are hoping to win a third straight title, versus the Philadelphia Eagles, who are hoping their mascot doesn’t die of bird flu."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Severance is about splitting your work self, aka your innie, and your outside self, aka your outie, into two different people. I get this. In stand-up comedy, we separate our fun trauma, which makes us all laugh, from our real trauma, which we do not talk about."
Taylor Tomlinson,"outtie” really is] “It would suck to hear, ‘Your outie still uses the word ‘awsomesauce.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"The Substance is a movie about an aging Hollywood starlet who who takes a drug that makes her body spit out a younger, hotter, more popular version of herself. Yes, like what Goldie Hawn injected to get Kate Hudson. Or what tennis injected to get pickleball."
Jimmy Fallon,"For all the players and coaches it’s a dream come true to play in the Super Bowl. And for all the referees, it’s a dream come true to see Patrick Mahomes in person."
Jimmy Fallon,"I don’t like to bet, but let’s just say if Taylor Swift and Donna Kelce side-hug more than six times, you might not see me on Monday."
Jimmy Fallon,"This year, the Super Bowl will be watched in 180 countries. Well, 179 if we take over Canada by Saturday."
Jimmy Kimmel,They believe it will be the largest group of people ever to see anyone call Drake a b*tch.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump will be at the game. This is fun, he said he’s going to let Elon pick the winner this year."
Jimmy Kimmel,I think the reason Trump’s going to the Super Bowl is he can’t stand to have one day where he’s on TV less than Taylor Swift.
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump goes to these prayer breakfasts because he doesn’t like it when people worship anyone other than him.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He covered a lot of subjects. He bragged about deporting immigrants, his war on diversity, fighting transgenders—all the sacred teachings of Jesus."
Jimmy Kimmel,"If Trump met Jesus, he’d call him a loser, he’d tell him to get a haircut and put a shirt on."
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump also told the audience we need to bring religion back. And who better to bring it back than the guy who sells God Bless the USA bibles for 59.99?
Jimmy Kimmel,"‘Anyway, condolences to the families. Now let me tell you how 9/11 was like skee-ball.'"
