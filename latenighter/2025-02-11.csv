name,monologue
Seth Meyers,"Uh oh, I got a bad feeling someone’s about to rename another body of water. Maybe more than one. ‘I’m issuing a proclamation that the five Great Lakes will henceforth be known as Lake America, Lake America, Lake America, Lake America, and Lake America. And if you forget, there’s a helpful mnemonic device which is AAAAA!'"
Seth Meyers,The only way this cover could have been worse for Trump is if they put a tiny little version of him on the desk in front of Elon.
Seth Meyers,You didn’t? You were just on the cover in December. Do you not remember anything that happened in front of Gulf of America Day?
Seth Meyers,"[On Trump telling reporters how surprised he is that the richest man in the world has so much time to spend taking apart government regulations] “If someone is spending a suspiciously large amount of time on something and you don’t know why, that’s a red flag. Trump’s like a guy who says, ‘You know, Dave, my trainer at the gym, spends so much time with my wife. He is so into her physical fitness journey. I personally wonder how he can devote the time to it when he’s so busy with his second career as an underwear model. You know what else is crazy? They keep ending up on the same vacations!"
Seth Meyers,"You think you can just launch a rocket into space without going through some government red tape? If that were the case, then we would see mom and pop rocket companies going up all over the country. ‘Hey, ya’ll want to see the moon up close? Come on down to Dave’s Rockets of Sarasota—our rocket rides are safe and fun!'"
Jon Stewart,"Who wouldn’t trade our current environment for 1870’s tariff-driven, be-candled, tuberculosis-laden, pre-industrial heyday?"
Jon Stewart,"Quick point of order, though. To the extent that we were at our richest from 1870 to 1913, it wasn’t so much ‘we’ as, like four guys. And we called them robber barons… as a sign of affection."
Jon Stewart,"Meanwhile, the rest of America, the leading cause of death was falling into a vat at work."
Jon Stewart,To the vats! And fill mine with burning tallow boy!
Jon Stewart,‘Don’t bring us your poor and huddled masses! Do you have any mathletes?'
Jon Stewart,"Of course they’re allowed to adjudicate the boundaries of that power! That’s the whole f*cking point of the judiciary, to interpret whether those powers are legitimate. You went to law school mother f*cker!"
Jon Stewart,The only alternative is the executive determines for himself what is constitutional. At which point there would be no guardrails against… ooohhhh.
Jon Stewart,That’s the sales pitch? ‘We just need someone on their side willing to lose everything for progress. Like a Russian dog being shot into outer space.'
Jon Stewart,"The point is, you told everybody you were going to be different. You weren’t going to turn out like your mean old dad who was so horrible to you when you were growing up. So we sat back. We let you spend your wild teen years experimenting with your ridiculous ideas of checks and balances because deep down we knew that when you got that nonsense out of your system, you’d be back."
Jon Stewart,"Kings get sh*t done. Now, is it sh*t you want done? Not necessarily."
Jon Stewart,"Invasions, economic exploitations, and now suggesting turning Gaza into a beachfront casino? Seems like even King George would have been like, ‘I don’t know guys. Feels like the situation’s a little more complicated than that, and I’m literally dying of medieval brain disease.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"The Eagles scored 24 points in just the first half. 24, or in NFL terms, one full Bill Belichick girlfriend."
Jimmy Fallon,"For all the Eagles fans it was the best night ever. And for everyone else, it was the longest three hours ever."
Jimmy Fallon,"Meanwhile, Tom Brady called his first Super Bowl as a broadcaster. Yeah, it’s amazing what they’re doing with A.I. these days."
Jimmy Fallon,"This year there were lots of great commercials for brands like Pringles, Doritos, Totinos, Häagen-Dazs, and Little Caesars. Or as Donald Trump calls them, the food pyramid."
Jimmy Fallon,Trump left before the third quarter while the Chiefs left halfway through the first.
Jimmy Fallon,It this the 23rd hour of The Today Show ?
Jimmy Fallon,"Paul and I used to do a show, pretty much exactly like this. We didn’t do the Chuck E. Cheese crap, but something very similar."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know, you have to work pretty hard to make even walking the Grammys red carpet with your naked wife the 12th craziest thing that you did this week."
Jimmy Kimmel,Everything he writes makes you think his account has been hacked.
Jimmy Kimmel,It’s interesting because his teeth are the one thing in his head I wouldn’t replace immediately if I was him.
Jimmy Kimmel,I wonder what HH stands for. Something tells me it’s not ‘Happy Holidays.'
Jimmy Kimmel,At what point does he just change his name to Ye-Dolph and be done with it?
Jimmy Kimmel,"Well, she didn’t get ‘booed out of the stadium.’ Unlike you she stayed for the whole game."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump’s just jealous of Taylor Swift because she’s got more followers, and more money, and no kids than he does."
Jimmy Kimmel,There is no better metaphor for a Trump presidency than a military flyover over a domed Super Bowl stadium.
Jimmy Kimmel,He’s declared war on pennies because he’s tired of Lincoln being the only president bronzer than he is.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Without pennies, how’s Trump gonna tip his housekeepers?"
Jimmy Kimmel,He’s only aware of magazines he’s been spanked with by a hooker.
