Jordan Klepper,"Yesterday there was a big announcement from Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, Trump’s top cabinet member if you go by blood alcohol level."
Jordan Klepper,"Whoa, whoa, whoa—you renamed Fort Bragg after a different Bragg? So after all that bitching about not giving into woke history, you’re basically admitting that we shouldn’t name military bases after Confederate generals. Well it’s a good thing woke is over, because I think I can say this now: That’s a p*ssy move, Hegseth."
Jordan Klepper,"Pete Hegseth basically said, ‘Find me a guy named Bragg who served in the army and didn’t own slaves.’ I mean, he didn’t even have a Wikipedia entry until today. Do you know how obscure you have to be to not have a Wikipedia page? There’s a Wikipedia page for cats that look like Hitler."
Jordan Klepper,"Why do I get the feeling Pete’s going to try to pull this with his wife? ‘Baby, baby, I didn’t cheat on you. Her name was also Susan, okay?'"
Jordan Klepper,"You know what, I applaud Donald Trump for letting a blue city mayor off the hook. This sends a message. Donald Trump is not about being a Democrat or a Republican. As long as you’re criminally corrupt, you’re his people."
Jordan Klepper,"Trump really loves getting his ass kissed, doesn’t he? Which probably explains why all his suit pants have that little trap door on the butt like old timey long underwear."

Seth Meyers,"The Philadelphia Eagles are set to host their victory parade this week on Valentine’s Day, in what’s being called the ultimate test for Philadelphia boyfriends."
Seth Meyers,"When asked during an interview on Friday how many times he’s spoken with Russian president Vladimir Putin since taking office, President Trump said, ‘I’d better not say.’ Even worse, a voice from his pocket said, [Russian accent] ‘Donald, who are you talking to?'"
Seth Meyers,"President Trump said on Friday he has spoken to Russian president Vladimir Putin on the phone to try to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine and added that the invasion never would have happened if he had been in office. Because if Trump was president, we would have invaded Ukraine."
