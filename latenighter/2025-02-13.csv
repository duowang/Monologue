Seth Meyers,Oh my God. These people get so upset when someone changes their pronoun but they treat world maps like f*cking Etch-A-Sketches.
Seth Meyers,"The point is not that Trump is a liar and hypocrite. Everyone knows that on both sides of the aisle. It’s that right-wing MAGA populism is a scam. When you hear Republicans claim they’re against nation-building and foreign wars, just remember they’re the ones that want to own and occupy Gaza, Greenland, Panama, and Canada. Even George W. Bush would be like, ‘Red White and Blueland sounds dumb as sh*t. And I’m the guy who said nu-cular.'"
Seth Meyers,"So if you’re keeping track at home, we still don’t have a plan for lowering egg prices but we do have a plan for building hotels in Gaza."
Seth Meyers,"When he first floated the plan, his chief of staff made a horrified face like she just saw the price of eggs."
Seth Meyers,"Oh cool, so to find out what our government is up to, we just have to wade through a sea of Nazis, ads for Cheech & Chong weed gummies, and bots with women in bikinis offering to send us one million units of something called sexcoin as long as we send our Social Security and bank routing numbers."
Seth Meyers,"Okay, first of all, don’t announce policy via emoji. When Biden did student loan forgiveness, he didn’t tweet ‘school emoji, graduation emoji, money emoji, weed emoji.'"
Seth Meyers,"mandate” means voters empowered him, Elon Musk, to slash the government] “No, they voted for lower grocery prices. At least according to your sleepy receptionist over there."
Seth Meyers,"Those prices will have you saying, ‘Sorry babe, I could only afford the pepperoni perfume.'"
Jordan Klepper,"Yes, Elon Musk is now in charge of all government heil-ings—hirings! Hirings. Sorry, I didn’t say that reich—right! I don’t know why I keep Hitler—misspeaking!"
Jordan Klepper,"I mean, everything about this event was so bizarre. Trump was sitting quietly for half an hour, retreating to his happy place thinking about Arnold Palmer’s giant DOGE."
Jordan Klepper,"Wow, I mean you can see why this guy’s a genius. You don’t want an unelected bureaucrat running the country. It makes a lot of sense, no questions here. I do have one question though—isn’t that you?"
Jordan Klepper,"Am I going crazy, because it feels like I’m watching Drake sing ‘Not Like Us’ at karaoke."
Jordan Klepper,Is having this one unaccountable bureaucrat in charge better than having those other unaccountable bureaucrats in charge? Because at least the others have to follow transparency laws. The only thing transparent about DOGE is Elon’s skin.
Jordan Klepper,"His financial disclosures are being kept secret, DOGE is exempt from open records laws, and when someone on Twitter merely identified some of the people who work for DOGE, Elon suspended their account and said ‘You have committed a crime.’ Which we tried to fact-check with career officials at the FBI, but they’re all working at a Panera now."
Jordan Klepper,"Well, I did the exam, and what an a**hole."
Jordan Klepper,"SpaceX has government contracts, Tesla is under government oversight, X is under government investigation, and his hair plugs are being investigated by the Department of No One’s Buying This."
Jordan Klepper,"nobody bats 1.000”] “You made up a $50 million conspiracy of sending condoms to Gaza.You’re not grounding out to third, you’re puking into the umpire’s mouth."
Jordan Klepper,"‘There’s no problem and nobody’s gonna question it?’ Trump is like a Jedi who doesn’t have the Force. ‘I’ll take Gaza, nobody’s gonna question it. [Futile hand gestures] Is this thing working?'"
Jordan Klepper,"We’re going to take it, we’re going to hold it, we’re going to cherish it"
Jordan Klepper,"I mean, how did that start like Mussolini speech and end as a Boyz II Men song?"
Jimmy Fallon,"Don Jr said, ‘Wait a minute, I was told there’s no such thing as take your son to work day.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was looking at him like, ‘Don’t you dare touch my dinosaur chicken nuggets.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Putin was like, ‘I told you I wouldn’t forget Valentine’s Day.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"The only awkward part of the call was when Putin said, ‘Is the president there?,’ and both Trump and Elon said, ‘Yes?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Joann Fabrics is closing 500 of its 800 stores. You could tell things are rough, ‘cause Joann just started an OnlyFabrics."
Jimmy Fallon,It’s all part of Trump’s plan to make American suck again.
Jimmy Fallon,"When Trump was told this might cause more turtles to die, he said, ‘I’m not concerned about Mitch McConnell.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Its tagline is, ‘Domino’s pepperoni perfume—It’s like being on an elevator with Joe Pesci.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Dominos guarantees that it will end your relationship in 30 minutes or less.
Jimmy Fallon,"So now the three most expensive things in the world are a Fabergé egg, a Cadbury egg, and an actual egg."
Jimmy Fallon,"The police said, ‘Hey, everyone knows you’re supposed to have sex behind the Wendy’s.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Even worse, Wendy was into it."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know things are tough when you read that an asteroid might be headed at us and my first thought is, ‘Oh finally, some good news!'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know the White House is trying to find a way to blame this on DEI, right? ‘They come from the blackness of space, these asteroids.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"weak”] “Does he have any self awareness at all? The character of Biff in Back to the Future is based on him , and that was 30 years before he became president."
Jimmy Kimmel,This is not what you say to the people you’re evicting from the place where they live. This is what you say to your parents when you’re about to put them in a retirement home.
Jimmy Kimmel,"And if you understood that, you probably never bankrupted a casino."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I would suggest, Mr. President, that if you have to flush your toilet nine times, it may not be the water pressure. You might want to take a look at your diet. Maybe don’t eat the triple Whopper with cheese."
Jimmy Kimmel,"pound down” on him, rather than giving him a “puny Biden drizzle"
Jimmy Kimmel,We’ve reached a point where old bald men are openly fantasizing about getting a good pounding in the shower thanks to Donald Trump.
