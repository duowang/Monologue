Jordan Klepper,"I’d like to know what those ‘various other subjects’ were. It’s a tad suspicious. It’s like a husband coming back from a Vegas bachelor party saying, ‘Yeah, we ate some great food, saw the Sphere, did some… various other things. Anyway, you should get a prescription for Valtrex.'"
Jordan Klepper,"But Trump won’t be going into this alone. He also has Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a man who does not take no for an answer, according to police reports."

If that’s what you mean, then yeah, man, you made it hot."
Seth Meyers,"Every time Trump speaks, I feel like a guy who started season two of Severance without watching season one."
Seth Meyers,"What could the richest man in the world, with a defense contract and a car company and a rocket company and a medical device company and a social media company and ties to foreign governments and large crypto holdings possibly have to gain from having direct control over the federal government? Okay, this time I am being sarcastic."
Seth Meyers,a daily colonoscopy” by federal investigators] “You do? Is that why you’re always making this face? He looks uncomfortable but also… intrigued.
