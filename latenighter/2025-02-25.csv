Jon Stewart,"[Woody Allen voice] ‘When I said you were criminal parasites, I obviously wasn’t referring to—I have the bird flu, come back to work, please.'"
Jon Stewart,Who amongst us hasn’t lied by saying something is 16 when it’s really two-and-a-half?
Jon Stewart,"And even if there was a 200-year-old man still walking around, he wouldn’t need Social Security. He’d be in Congress."
Jon Stewart,I just saved us billions of dollars in 11 seconds! Just call me Big Balls !
Jon Stewart,We’re getting f*cked at a Diddy party and they’re making us buy the baby oil.
Jon Stewart,"Airlines get billions in bailouts that they use in stock buybacks and bonuses. But if you’re on food assistance, you’re not allowed to buy hot food with it. Because apparently heated entrées are for winners."
Jon Stewart,"Every day, at 5 p.m. sharp, the Democrats should go live on Facebook and do the people’s audit. Find the absurdities and the remedies in our exploitative system. Get someone like AOC, or Jasmine Crockett, or Chris Murphy. [Photo of Chuck Schumer] Or anybody that doesn’t sound like they’re complaining that there isn’t any more frozen yogurt at the cafeteria in the Villages."
Jon Stewart,"It’s not MAGA. It’s something more like: Make America Not Governed In Obviously Negative—whoa, abort!"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Cause you know what, after all this time who can remember who invaded who? I mean it was three years ago. It might have been Chris Rock who threw his face at Will Smith’s slappin’ hand."
Stephen Colbert,"It’s subtle, but there’s been a little shift in our foreign policy. We’re gonna have to retroactively change a few of our Cold War movies, so get ready for A Hug for Red October ."
Stephen Colbert,"Musk celebrated gutting the federal government last week at CPAC, the National Conference of Brothers-in-Law You Don’t Talk to Any More."
Stephen Colbert,Our federal workforce is in the clutches of a heartless billionaire who wants to colonize Mars with vehicles shaped like his penis. By which I mean Cybertrucks—he should see a doctor.
Stephen Colbert,"Now obviously, the only proper response to that is. ‘What did I do last week? 1.) Your mom. 2.) Your mom. 3.) Your mom. 4.) Your mom. And 5.) Your mom.'"
Stephen Colbert,"But Elon made sure folks would see it, because the email was labeled, ‘Importance: High.’ The sender? Even higher."
Stephen Colbert,[Very unemphatically] Oh no. Be careful. You might get hurt.
Stephen Colbert,"Now, warning. If you have kids… get them in here to see how great this is."
Stephen Colbert,"Someone hacked the TV system and played this A.I. video of Trump slurpin’ on Elon’s toes. Or as Trump calls them, ‘ten-piece foot nuggets.'"
Stephen Colbert,"He’s right, we can’t make fun of anything any more. For instance, if I said that outfit he’s wearing looks like a coke dealer from 1993, I would be arrested."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump has played golf on nine of his first 30 days of work, while you’re making payments on an egg salad sandwich."
Jimmy Kimmel,"But Trump and Elon, what a team. We’ve got a dick and a tater in charge of everything."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I mean seriously, if that guy walked into your office and told you he was there to start making cuts, everybody would jump on him and put him in a headlock."
Jimmy Kimmel,Comedy is still legal! And that right there is why you don’t fire a thousand nerds at once.
Jimmy Kimmel,I love when a new Trump tell-all pops up. For me it’s the equivalent of a surprise Beyoncé album dropping.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The book claims Trump really wanted a female Vice President, but instead settled for a man who wears eyeliner."

Jimmy Fallon,The White House believes the [foot-licking] video was created by a disgruntled employee. So that narrows it down to the entire federal workforce.
Jimmy Fallon,"Doctors are warning against a new viral TikTok trend in which users are dropping heavy objects on their feet. You know, at a certain point we just have to let evolution do its thing."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, he was inspired by Michael Jordan. I presume specifically in the field of weird little mustaches."
Taylor Tomlinson,This is so hot to me because it means he has never done stand-up comedy in his life.
Taylor Tomlinson,Be sure to do a wellness check on your uncle today.
Taylor Tomlinson,It doesn’t make sense because Hooters is usually the one restaurant that benefits from inflation. That was an uncle joke.
Taylor Tomlinson,"To keep up with their rivals, the New York Mets announced that Mrs. Met will be given a full bush."
