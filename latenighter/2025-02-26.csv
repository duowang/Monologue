Desi Lydic,Donald Trump promised that he could secure a peace deal within one day of taking office. Which means he is now negative 34 days ahead of schedule.
Desi Lydic,"This is how off the rails Trump is. His beloved Fox News is saying, ‘Mister President, you sound crazy—and I believe DEI causes tornadoes.'"
Desi Lydic,"Yeah, Donald Trump just loves a French accent. Probably because it’s the native tongue of his hero, Pepé Le Pew. Something about that pervert skunk that Trump finds so relatable."
Desi Lydic,"Look at that smile, the guy is smitten. Usually if someone confronts him about being wrong, he takes away their security detail."
Desi Lydic,"I think a sexy accent is his kryptonite. I assumed it was vegetables, but…"
Desi Lydic,"I mean, is Trump sure he wants to be president? Because this is the worst job in the world if you don’t understand accents. It’s like working as an escort if you’re still not 100 percent sure which hole it’s supposed to go in."
Desi Lydic,"But if you do have to have a translator for accents, why does the translator also have an accent? Maybe the plan was to have a string of translators with slightly less of an accent until they finally got to something Trump could process? Eventually it’ll just be the word ‘Bangladesh’ written across the boobs of a swimsuit model."
Desi Lydic,"I can’t believe DOGE is going around looking for inefficiencies, meanwhile Trump has an English-to English translator."
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, that has some real ‘gently correcting grandma’ energy. ‘No, ma-ma, remember? Nurse Maria helps you. We found the earrings you were missing inside your nightstand, so let’s take our hand off the fire alarm, okay?'"
Stephen Colbert,Eventually they had to clear the room when Trump asserted his dominance by expressing his anal glands.
Stephen Colbert,"Media, do better. Try to focus on the global implications of… [retching noise at picture of Trump’s bruise.]"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Semi-fired or you’re fired.’ That’s a boss anyone would want to work for. ‘Kristen, you’re semi-fired. Put half your stuff in a box and get out of here. Then come back after lunch, ‘cause you’re a semi-valued part of this team.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Forget running the government, these clowns couldn’t get 10 bridesmaids to a paint and sip."
Stephen Colbert,"That is a unified team? ‘Okay boys, listen up. Bring it in. Remember what we practiced, we drilled on this. Get out there and do… literally the first insane thing that comes in your mind, okay? No bad ideas. Hank, you try and sit on the ball and hatch it like an egg. Timmy, you knit me a scarf out of your own hair. The rest of you, I don’t know, I don’t care. Maybe lay on the grass and act like you’re swimmin’ in it.'” on white house press secretary karoline leavitt saying this is all normal"
Stephen Colbert,That answer—somewhat stupid.” on trump now clarifying that workers who don’t respond to the sedond email are “somewhat fired
Jimmy Kimmel,"What if that was his catchphrase on The Apprentice . ‘Meat Loaf, you’re fired—or semi-fired.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s somewhat voluntary, but if you don’t respond, he guesses you get fired. Thanks for clearing that up. I think it might be time to give the planet to the apes because we’re finished."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Who knew you could fire people at a place where you don’t even work. I might try it at Chipotle sometime, just to see what happens."
Jimmy Kimmel,You know how Smokey Bear says only you can prevent forest fires? It’s about to be true.
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know what they say, If at first you strand hundreds of people on an island with no food or water, try, try again."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He did four years for wire fraud, for bank fraud, and making false statements to law enforcement. How he’s not part of the Trump administration already, I have no idea."
Jimmy Fallon,Either that’s a bruise or he was testing different makeups at Sephora.
Jimmy Fallon,It’s not great when you have the same medical symptoms as a banana.
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s confusing. When you walk in the White House and say ‘Who is in charge?,’ everyone shrugs like they’re working at Lids."
Jimmy Fallon,Now your mom knows how your father feels about Hooters going bankrupt.
Jimmy Fallon,Even the people who invested in Hawk Tuah crypto think this is a bad idea.
Jimmy Fallon,"A French cheese company set a world record by cooking 4,800 pounds of cheese fondue. The cheese will now be stored for three months and then served on white bread at Fyre Fest II."
Taylor Tomlinson,This is genius. Married men can’t hook up with a woman covered in glitter unless they want to go home to their wives covered in glitter. It’s the same reason I don’t eat powdered donuts before seeing my nutritionist.
Taylor Tomlinson,"To be honest, I don’t think this is gonna stop guys from cheating. No, they’ll just go home all sparkly like, ‘Babe, relax, you know me and the boys do crafts on Fridays.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"But ladies, you don’t need glitter. Take it from me, all you have to do to avoid being chased by married guys is turn 30."
Taylor Tomlinson,"I never thought I’d hear adults say, ‘I’m going to give you this money, but you have to use it to buy drugs. I mean it—do not come home with textbooks again.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"I actually don’t think this is a compliment to Spirit Airlines. I think it’s a compliment to the people who are brave enough to fly Spirit Airlines. Because that is a survivor. You made it through the fist fights at the check-in desk, the illegal cockfighting ring during boarding, and the Spirit employees roundhouse-kicking anyone with a carryon."
