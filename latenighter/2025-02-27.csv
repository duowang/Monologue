Desi Lydic,"Today was a big day for Donald Trump. He had a meeting with every member of his cabinet, and he even invited the president."
Desi Lydic,"I’m sorry, you ‘accidentally, very briefly cancelled’ what? I hate to be giving efficiency notes to the efficiency master, but perhaps next time we keep ebola prevention going the whole time."
Desi Lydic,"Is Elon really asking for credit for only cancelling ebola prevention a little bit? It’s like he dropped a baby and went, ‘What? Look how fast I picked it up! Five second rule.'"
Desi Lydic,"Oh, ‘green card privileges plus.’ See, I was still getting America with ads."
Desi Lydic,Did this guy just put a cover charge on America?
Desi Lydic,"I mean, I guess it beats the old way of becoming a citizen, which was to marry Donald Trump, but still."
Desi Lydic,"Quick question—when you say ‘we have measles outbreaks every year,’ are you talking about America or, like, you? ‘Cause right now it sounds like you might take out that whole room. And that would be… terrible, I want to say?"
Stephen Colbert,"Everybody was there: RFK Jr, Pete Hegseth, Sean Duffy, Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem. It was a who’s who of ‘why them?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Well of course. I mean, we have all had that call with tech support. Hello? Your computer’s frozen? Have you tried turning it off? Uh huh. And then firing 4,000 people with an email?"
Stephen Colbert,"That long, rambling response actually reminds me of circumcision, because someone really should have cut that dickhead off."
Stephen Colbert,Reporters did reach out to Gleason but Gleason declined to comment. I am not surprised. It is really hard to speak clearly when you’re under a bus.
Stephen Colbert,"Echoing the eternal words on the Statue of Liberty, ‘Give your tired, your poor… psych! Gimme 5 million bucks, beeyotch! We buyin’ bottles in the clurrb.'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Green card privileges plus?’ So Trump’s gonna Delta Comfort our immigration system? ‘It’s great, there’s green card, green card plus, and green card world traveler, folks. You get lounge access, a hot towelette, all the little cheese cubes you can stack up.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Now those… are definitely numbers. Five, ten, fifty million trillion. I’m just putting this out there, what if we sold a hundred-zundred-gabba-gillion? Something to think about."
Stephen Colbert,"Well I’m sure that will only attract good people and zero criminals. [ Sopranos voice] ‘Yeah, I got a good guy to bring in. He can get rid of a body like that. I mean, he’s really good at playing the flute or computers or whatever the f*ck.'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Yeah, could be. Could be Russian oligarchs. Or some other nice folks I’ve met: Mister Skeletor, Gargamel, Nosferatu.'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Okay, welcome. I will now take questions on the United States’ grain exports to Malaysia. Yes, the gentleman from Fartcoin.biz. I’ll come to you next, Kanye.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The correspondent added, ‘But I’m sure one we put the finishing touches on this monster we helped stitch together out of body parts and rage, he’ll be our friend again.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Buddy, you were all cooked the minute you didn’t stand up for the AP . At this point, the meat has fallen off the bone and he’s covering you with lemon slices all over your body. And obviously, some pumpable cheese."
Jimmy Kimmel,Get your golden tickets from President Oompa J. Loompa.
Jimmy Kimmel,What a great idea. I’ve always said our immigration system should be run more like the customer rewards program at a casino in Atlantic City.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The land of the free—and by free, I mean five million bucks."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Let me tell you something, he may know oligarchs—but not as well as they know him ."
Jimmy Kimmel,It’s all part of his plan to ensure groceries cost a million dollars a month.
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s right, we have ‘curfews on water.’ All water has to be in bed by ten o’clock, or it’s grounded."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I know that if you don’t live in Southern California, you assume there must be some little shred of truth to that story he just told. There’s not. There’s no limits on water, there’s no curfew on water, and the only thing he ‘wettened’ is the diaper he puts on every day."
Jimmy Fallon,"The meeting was very productive. The first half was spent kissing Trump’s butt, the second half was spent kissing Elon’s."
Jimmy Fallon,"At one point, Elon acknowledged that his team had accidentally cancelled an ebola prevention program but the quickly fixed it. I don’t think that’s as reassuring as you think it is."
Jimmy Fallon,"The Trump administration just announced that it is hand-picking the reporters who are allowed to cover Trump and ask him questions. Yup, Trump will now only take questions from Fox News, Foxier News, and Foxiest News."
Jimmy Fallon,McDonald’s just announced one dollar Egg McMuffin day. It’s a little suspicious when an Egg McMuffin is cheaper than an actual egg.
Jimmy Fallon,"Royal Caribbean is launching a Star Trek -themed cruise to celebrate the show’s 60th anniversary. We already have a Star Trek cruise, it’s called Virgin Voyages."
Taylor Tomlinson,"America could never do this. Whenever a painting starts moving you, they’re like, ‘Close your eyes, your insurance doesn’t cover this.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Obviously, this prescription is for mental health only. You’re not going to break your leg and hear a doctor be like, ‘Quick, get this man extra strength Picasso!'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Hey, it is fun to find out what Donald Trump would be doing if he wasn’t president."
