Desi Lydic,"Oooh, okay. You guys kiss your lobbyists with that mouth?"
Desi Lydic,This is what happens when you’re the party of liberal arts majors. MAGA storms the Capitol and Democrats are doing creative writing exercises.
Desi Lydic,I don’t know how but I think that this congressman somehow lost the beef for Kendrick.
Desi Lydic,"I do think every rap battle should end with, ‘Thank you, I yield my time.'"
Desi Lydic,Is this how white ladies protest now? ‘I demand to dance for the manager!'
Desi Lydic,"This really feels like his moment. Too bad he’ll be 87 years old by the time the next election rolls around. Unless we can give him The Substance . I don’t know, I’m halfway through that movie. I assume it all works out?"
Desi Lydic,Yes! Andy Cohen will never make a show as good as what I just watched.
Desi Lydic,"That’s how you do it. Forget singing, forget dancing, this is how you confront Trump—with tipsy aunt energy."
Jimmy Kimmel,First the ‘deep state’ agents need to go through the documents and make sure they dot every ‘I’ and cross out every ‘DJT.'
Jimmy Kimmel,"Basically they will give us access to their valuable minerals in exchange for us not letting Putin kill them all. In other words, the guy who was impeached for trying to extort Ukraine, tomorrow is planning to do it again in front of everyone."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Ukraine has a big chunk of the world’s lithium reserves, which is what they use in batteries for electric cars. Man, if only Trump knew someone who could use that sort of thing, you know?"
Jimmy Kimmel,Putting Elon Musk in charge of government contracts is like putting Pac Man in charge of fruit.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump said they would be fired if they didn’t, then said they wouldn’t be fired, then he said they would be semi-fired. Now he’s saying they’ll be wood-fired, with caramelized onions and maybe a handful of asiago cheese."
Jimmy Kimmel,"These are jobs held mostly by veterans. And it’s a tricky situation for Donald Trump because we know he doesn’t think much of veterans, but he loves affairs."
Jimmy Kimmel,They have been just about efficient as a Cybertruck in two inches of snow.
Jimmy Kimmel,Maybe let’s not get rid of that Department of Education just yet.
Stephen Colbert,"Kinda hard to feel a lot of sympathy for them. They ordered the turd soup and then said, ‘Waiter, there’s turds in my soup,’ then they came back four years later and said, ‘Hey, ya’ll still have that turd soup?'"
Stephen Colbert,Well that’s not surprising. That’s how Trump raised Eric.
Stephen Colbert,That sounds really bad. But can you ever really know where you are on the uncertainty index?
Stephen Colbert,Experts say that egg prices could jump 41 percent. Which means this year’s Easter egg hunt is gonna be The Purge .
Stephen Colbert,The head of the smuggling operation—Pablo Eggscobar.
Stephen Colbert,"So if no one’s picking what’s in the vaccine next year, I say you administer it to yourself with a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine. ‘Okay, I’m gonna do a little strain A, a little strain D, and, ooh—a touch of root beer.'"
Stephen Colbert,"There is a pill that makes you live longer but instead of giving it to humans, they’re giving it to dogs? That… is the correct decision."
Stephen Colbert,Because a dog is man’s best friend and no one has ever said that about man.
Jimmy Fallon,"The Oscars celebrate all the incredible, innovative, and inspiring movies that you’re waiting to watch on Netflix."
Jimmy Fallon,"Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo will open the show with a performance from Wicked . I don’t know, does Wicked really work on stage?"
Jimmy Fallon,"I heard that this year’s Oscars gift bag contains $200,000 dollars worth of items. That’s right, it’s one carton of eggs."
Jimmy Fallon,"This year, the Best Actor nominees include Timothée Chalamet for his role as Bob Dylan and Elon Musk for his role as president."
Jimmy Fallon,That must have been a fun tweet to read while you were in mid-flight today.
Jimmy Fallon,"Tomorrow, Party City is closing all of their stores. There’s nothing more somber than letting the air out of a hundred balloons that say ‘Congrats.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Tropicana orange juice could be headed for bankruptcy. Right now, Sunny D is like, ‘How the hell are we still here?'"
Taylor Tomlinson,It’s honestly a great new slogan for Hinge. ‘Hinge: He’s gonna have a weird voice.'
Taylor Tomlinson,"If a guy looks hot in his photos and has a normal bio, he’s definitely going to show up sounding like Jar-Jar Binks."
Taylor Tomlinson,"The f*cked up thing is you hope he has a weird voice. Because if he looks good, has a fun personality, and has a nice voice, he’s probably cheating on his wife and calling it ‘networking.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, they’re either gonna kill you or your self-esteem."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Doesn’t it feel like her friend’s walking her to the first day of school? Like, ‘Okay, you have to be brave and go inside but I’ll pick you up if you vomit, promise.'"
