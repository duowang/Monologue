Jon Stewart,"I’ll be honest, I don’t think this network makes any other programming. So we could do whatever the f*ck we want as long as we wrap before the new season of South Park ."
Jon Stewart,"Again, the guy who made his own custom made ‘Dark MAGA’ hat that he wears to opine in the Oval Office with the president who he spent 270 million dollars to elect… thinks I’m just too partisan."
Jon Stewart,"I’m really not sure what he thinks bipartisan means, but it’s generally not, ‘I support Donald Trump, and also Germany’s AfD party .’ That’s not bipartisan, that’s just the same sh*t."
Jon Stewart,"But can we just drop the pretense that you won’t do it because I just don’t measure up to the standards of neutral discourse that you demand and display at all times, because that’s bullsh*t."
Jon Stewart,"I think it was Churchill during World War II who was criticized for being ‘a bit lippy.’ [Catty voice] ‘Excuse me, mister, we’ll decide where you’re going to fight them, whether it’s on the beaches or not or whatever.'"
Jon Stewart,"Poor guy, Zelenskyy. His nation was invaded, he’s held off a much bigger army for three years. And we’re like, ‘Would it kill you to smile a little more, dress a little nicer?'"
Jon Stewart,"Yeah, bullsh*t. I’m pretty sure everybody wants to end all wars… Hitler wanted to end the war—just not the way it ended."
Jon Stewart,"Yeah, I’m sure your heart—in quotation marks—is breaking."
Jon Stewart,"Yes, people get terribly afraid when someone viciously takes their side. They must be quaking in their—what is it Russians wear on their feet? Is it something like shoes inside other shoes and they get very small, until…"
Jon Stewart,"They are f*cking delighted. Do you know how hard it is to delight a Russian? There’s only two ways to do it—break up the Western democratic order, or bear on roller skates."
Jon Stewart,"You poor dumb bastards. It makes perfect sense, if only you watch American wrestling. It was a heel turn designed to create the alliance Trump always wanted in the first place. What’s to understand? Trump and the Republicans like Putin better."
Stephen Colbert,"So things were looking promising, but then everything exploded and collapsed. It’s a phenomenon political scientists refer to as the Emilia Peréz Oscar campaign."
Stephen Colbert,"No, it’s an important question. In the Oval Office, there is a strict dress code of decorum. You must either look like a businessman, [picture of Elon Musk] or a guy trying other hand you a flier outside of a strip club."
Stephen Colbert,"Damn! [Zelenskyy accent] ‘Is nice suit. The store where you bought that—they also have men’s department? Seriously, where you get that suit, Jos. A Bankrupt?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, J.D. What kind of diplomacy are you talking about? An ally of the United States is defending his people against a bloodthirsty war criminal and you’re scolding him like a little kid who left a wet towel on a wood floor."
Stephen Colbert,Do you know how bad things have to get for all of Europe to agree on anything? They can’e even agree on the way their toilets should be weird.
Stephen Colbert,"Oh great, Europe’s gonna get their own giant military now. We can’t re-arm Germany! [Whispers] You know how they get. And they’re good at it."
Seth Meyers,"The guy’s the leader of a country that was invaded by Russian and you’re grilling him like a fop at a garden party. [Catty voice] I have a question, is your stylist legally blind or just far-sighted?'"
Seth Meyers,"No they f*cking don’t. People have concerns about the cost of groceries, not whether the president of Ukraine has ever been to a Men’s Wearhouse. I don’t see you asking Elon Musk if he owns a suit, even though he shows up to cabinet meetings looking like a Lithuanian record producer."
Seth Meyers,Musk dresses like it’s casual Friday on the Death Star.
Seth Meyers,"That’s right, hasn’t this poor man suffered enough? This poor, shirtless man. He can’t even afford a car, he has to ride a horse to work. Won’t you please help this Russian dictator. You can help end his suffering today with just a $25 donation to ASPCV (through American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Vlad)."
Seth Meyers,"None of that made any sense whatsoever. If you heard those words come out of anyone else’s mouth, you’d say, ‘Oh my God, there was something else in that adderall.'"
Seth Meyers,"Trump’s disastrous meeting with Ukrainian President Zelelnskyy started to go off the rails when J.D. Vance, a former Cabbage Patch Doll who, when given one wish from a magical fairy, wished to be an assh*le, intervened to suck up to Trump."
Seth Meyers,"J.D. Vance sounds like a boyfriend who just got caught cheating for the third time. ‘You keep asking where I was, but have you said thank you once for the bracelet I got you?’ ‘That was two years ago and I said thank you when you gave it to me.’ ‘But have you said thank you during this fight?'"
Seth Meyers,"Oh come on, Marco, don’t act like you weren’t trying to disappear into the couch during that meeting. You look like a five-year-old at a wedding who just got put into a time out."
Seth Meyers,You thought Marco Rubio was going to stand up to Donald Trump? There a better chance of Kermit standing up without a hand up his ass.
Taylor Tomlinson,This music makes it sound like the Academy killed all those people.
Taylor Tomlinson,How am I supposed to mourn Maggie Smith when it sounds like Kendall Roy is trying to take over his father’s company?
Taylor Tomlinson,"It’s appropriate to play fashion police on the Oscars’ red carpet, but you know where it’s not appropriate? In the Oval Office."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, this right-wing reporter asked Zelenskyy why he wasn’t wearing a suit. Um, because he’s in the middle of a war? Would you go up to a firefighter trying to hose down a burning building like, ‘Why is your coat so big?'"
Taylor Tomlinson,These ultra-conservatives would probably berate a waiter for having wet hair on the Titanic.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Trump is always trying to bully people into doing whatever he wants. Luckily, here at CBS/Paramount, we are standing up to him so we can stay on the right side of history. Yeah! We’re not gonna just—what’s that? [Holds hand to earpiece as headline shows Paramount ending DEI policy in deference to Trump’s executive orders] Sh*t, you guy, come on."
Taylor Tomlinson,"J.D. also yelled at Zelenskyy—like father, like douchebag."
Taylor Tomlinson,‘Have you said thank you?’ He’s talking to the President of Ukraine like a frat bro pissed off at his date. ‘I bought you this beautiful meal from Outback and now you’re telling me you won’t f*ck me? I want my Bloomin’ Onion back.'
Taylor Tomlinson,"[Zelenskyy] left the Oval Office like a Bachelor contestant getting kicked out of the mansion. And we were all like, ‘Go, you can do better, run!'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Right across the street at the Dolby Theater, Adrien Brody is just wrapping up his acceptance speech."
Jimmy Kimmel,Conan did such a good job that today the Oscars announced that next year they’re giving it to Jay Leno to host.
Jimmy Kimmel,"This might have been Trump’s most mortifying moment yet, and this is a guy who suggested we inject bleach into our bodies."
Jimmy Kimmel,[Over that picture of Putin] Everyone knows Donald Trump prefers his leaders shirtless and on a horse.
Jimmy Kimmel,"This poor man. They’re bombing every hospital is his country, he’s sitting there with the halfwit fashion police."
Jimmy Kimmel,We haven’t seen Trump yelling at a foreigner like that since the last time Melania locked him out of the bedroom.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Siding with Trump is one thing, siding with Putin is—well, I guess it’s the same thing."
Jimmy Fallon,"Usually when you hear about something 97 years old lasting four hours, it’s time to call a doctor."
Jimmy Fallon,"It lasted nearly four hours—not the show, Adrien Brody’s acceptance speech."
Jimmy Fallon,He made four acceptance speeches and still talked less than Adrien Brody.
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump made English our official language and then he was asked about bringing down the price of eggs and he was like, ‘No hablo ingles.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"After two decades, Skype is shutting down. Employees knew it was time when the farewell meeting was held over Zoom."
Jimmy Fallon,"Today, Dominos released their own version of a stuffed-crust pizza. Everyone was like, ‘What’s it stuffed with?’ And they said, ‘Yes.'"
