Stephen Colbert,"This is a live Mardi Gras audience right now. And it is so fitting, because just like on Bourbon Street, tonight we all got to see some boobs."
Stephen Colbert,"No, no, I disagree. I think it’s impressive that with only three people it can still be a clown car."
Stephen Colbert,"‘That dream, an affordable Denver omelette. We will get there one day.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Now, some people have questioned why so much muscle was needed to remove one old man with a cane. But it turns out it was for a serious reason. When security searched him, they found that he’d smuggled in a spine."
Stephen Colbert,Oh thank goodness. Somebody go tell Congressman Green. Just go knock on the side of that windowless van they shoved him into.
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, I don’t know. Try saying, ‘I resign.'"
Stephen Colbert,‘And the days of rule by unelected billionaires have just begun.'
Stephen Colbert,"The Democrats came ready to fight back with their little paddles! That is how you save democracy, by quietly dissenting. Or bidding on an antique tea set—it was hard to tell what was going on."
Stephen Colbert,"‘No, it’s true. Mally, Lessotoo, all those fake countries in the imaginary continent of Ooofrica.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, that’s not good, but let’s all be thankful he didn’t try to pronounce Niger."
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, but when you’re a farmer, technically isn’t every day a field day?"
Stephen Colbert,"But isn’t it weird for members of Congress to applaud him for taking all of their power away? ‘Wooo! We’re worthless worms! Choke us, Daddy!'"
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, we know. Rumor is, he often drinks until he can’t stay a-woke."
Stephen Colbert,That checks out. I have seen your cabinet and there are pieces of ship all over the White House these days.
Stephen Colbert,You could quit.” on trump whining that there’s nothing he could do to make democrats cheer (he and colbert with some parallel thinking)
Jimmy Kimmel,"Any time this maniac speaks, it’s a joint session. It’s a joint session, it’s an edible session, it’s a ‘raid the medicine cabinet for anything to dull the pain’ kind of night."
Jimmy Kimmel,His speech started late. I guess they were waiting for that last coat of shellac to dry on his face.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Even Melania showed up, so Democrats weren’t the only people who hate him there."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He laid out his MAGA-genda for the next four years. They include wildly unpopular tariffs, abandoning our allies, buddying up to Russia, tax cuts for the rich, and turning Gaza into Atlantic City—all the reasons blue collar American voted for this man."
Jimmy Kimmel,"According to a new poll on CNN, 52 percent of Americans do not approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president. The other 48 percent responded in Russian, so we don’t know exactly what they think."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The stock market’s down, consumer confidence is down, the dollar is down. The only things that are high are egg prices and Elon Musk."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s like we remarried an ex-husband and now we’re like, ‘Oh right, he cheats and steals and farts and snores all the time.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Which actually is a calculated move, because if you can’t afford a car you can’t complain about the price of gas. Smart. It’s that 4-D chess he’s always playing."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Most experts are saying he’s shooting himself in the foot with these tariffs. Which is bad—you know, he’s already got those bone spurs that kept him out of Vietnam."
Jimmy Kimmel,"People are so drunk down there, some of them are at risk of being appointed Secretary of Defense."
Michael Kosta,"Donald Trump has been busy. In the past couple of days, he’s switched sides on the war in Ukraine, announced a national crypto reserve, and dismantled the National Weather Service. Because part of the fun of experiencing a Category 5 hurricane is the surprise."
Michael Kosta,"Now Mexico, they expect it, right? Trump’s had it out for them since no one showed up to his quinceañera. But why Canada? We’ve always been tight with Canada. We were both British colonies, we play in the same sports leagues together, we share joint custody of Ryan Gosling."
Michael Kosta,"Wait, we’re launching a trade war and it’s gonna affect us? I’m gonna pay $9,000 more for a Kia Sorrento? Now I finally get why they say war is hell. So that’s what Saving Private Ryan was all about."
Michael Kosta,Isn’t this the opposite of what Trump campaigned on—raising prices on everything? I’m already buying my eggs in installments on Klarna.
Michael Kosta,"Yes, great idea! In this time of uncertainty, the one thing I need right now is a wild animal pecking my dick while I’m trying to make a frittata."
Michael Kosta,‘Everybody who’s not a farmer wants to be.’ Are you kidding me? Americans don’t even go to grocery stores any more. We just text ‘get Cheerios’ to strangers on Instacart.
Michael Kosta,"Wait, why am I buying my steel like a sucker when I could be smelting iron ore in my own bathtub?"
Michael Kosta,"Damn you, Joe Biden! You were supposed to leave the password to the economy on the White House fridge before you left."
Michael Kosta,"If we’re gonna blame past presidents, why stop at Biden. Jimmy Carter’s been awfully quiet lately."
Michael Kosta,"Huh, so it’s not fentanyl or migrants. And it can’t be because Trump’s an insecure alpha male thumping his chest so the world pays attention to him, so I guess we’ll never know—it’s probably Joe Biden."
Michael Kosta,"Wow, he’s mad. And he’s not even world leader mad, he’s dad mad. This is the same tone I use when I tell my daughter not to throw he baby sister into the crib. ‘You are not the type of person who does this. Even though you just did this, and you’ll probably keep doing it.'"
Jimmy Fallon,It’s all part of Trump’s plan to make everything more expensive so eggs seem cheaper by comparison.
Jimmy Fallon,"In response to Trump’s tariffs, major retailers like Target and Best Buy said that they are going to raise prices. Target called the tariffs disruptive, while Best Buy said, ‘Oh my God, did you just call us a major retailer?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"The tariffs are expected to send car prices soaring to as much as 12 thousand dollars a vehicle. That means soon the price of a Nissan Sentra could be $12,750."
Jimmy Fallon,"Meanwhile, the price of imported fruits and vegetables will also increase. Trump heard and was like, ‘Well, no worries here.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump’s tariffs will also raise the prices of scrap metal, batteries, and auto parts. Which are all ingredients used to build Elon Musk."
Jimmy Fallon,Even Netflix plans to raise their subscription price. But that has nothing to do with the tariffs.
Jimmy Fallon,Do you know how bad things have to be for Canadians to do something mean?
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah it was quite a night. There were about 400 people in attendance. 300 were members of Congress, and a hundred were Elon’s kids."
Jimmy Fallon,"The night was pretty much a welcome back party for Trump, Republicans, and measles."
Jimmy Fallon,"Spirit is also gonna also have free wifi, but only when it’s parked next to an American Airlines plane."
Jimmy Fallon,"Wow, even the fake FBI is being let go."
Seth Meyers,"President Trump spoke tonight before a joint session of Congress. We don’t know how it went, but Marco Rubio has sunk even further into the couch."
Seth Meyers,"President Trump has reportedly focused on winning a Nobel Peace Prize for ending the war in Ukraine. I hope he attends the ceremony, but he’s gonna be pretty busy with his war in Canada."
Seth Meyers,"Fox News on Sunday published an op-ed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It’s titled, Measles Are Just God’s Freckles."
Seth Meyers,"The Los Angeles grocery store chain Erewhon is facing criticism for offering a single strawberry for $19. Or, for the same price, they’ll let you look at an egg."
Seth Meyers,Domino’s Pizza has launched the chain’s first stuffed-crust pizza. And it might be a big seller because apparently it’s stuffed with better pizza.
Seth Meyers,"Delta Airlines has reportedly offered passengers who were on the flight that crash landed in Toronto $30 thousand dollars each. Or in airport terms, a large water and two bananas."
Seth Meyers,"The second annual Florida Man Games were held over the weekend outside St. Augustine. Sadly, several contestants were disqualified for testing negative for meth."
Taylor Tomlinson,"They say it was because kids were spending too much time in the bathroom, which, how do you know it’s because of the mirror? That could be the regular meeting of the IBS club."
Taylor Tomlinson,"At a time when kids are so addicted to their phones, I actually found it refreshing that some kids are going analog with their narcissism. I guess staring at yourself in the mirror is the new reading a book in selfies?"
Taylor Tomlinson,"This would not have worked for me in high school. I’d be more self-conscious if I couldn’t check how I looked. I’d be passing notes in class like, ‘Hey, can you draw my bangs?'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Obviously, Zuckerberg did not do a flip . The only person he bends over backwards for is Trump."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Look, I’m not super familiar with Benson Boone, but has gotta be tough to find out you’re the exact same size as Mark Zuckerberg."
Taylor Tomlinson,"It’s so clear that Zuckerberg did this because he was like, ‘I’m tired of people calling me a boring creep. I wanna be a sparkly creep.'"
