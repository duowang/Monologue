Seth Meyers,"His speech was so long, Adrien Brody played him off."
Seth Meyers,"Thankfully, Republicans would never stoop to such an unruly display. When they disagree with the actions of Congress, they express those disagreements the right way. By putting on a big ol’ ornamental Viking headdress, scaling the walls with Trump flags and smashing windows, and stealing a podium."
Seth Meyers,"Also, can we please cool it the whole ‘whither decorum?’ dance? This guy’s changed the game and these are the new rules. He literally called Elizabeth Warren ‘Pocahontas’ again last night, which is deeply offensive and also a film that is 20 minutes shorter than the speech last night."
Seth Meyers,"At least Al Green last night was interrupting to protect Medicaid, unlike Marjorie Taylor Green, who was demanding to know, you know, ‘Where are you hiding the Dalmatians.'"
Seth Meyers,Paddles? Are you guys headed out for a game of pickleball after this?
Seth Meyers,"‘Captain Chaos?’ No offense, but that’s kind of rad. I mean, if Trump started calling Elon Musk Captain Chaos, he’d definitely start wearing it on a t-shirt."
Seth Meyers,"I’m sorry, but nobody gives a f*ck about Ronald Reagan. I mean, remember the Reagan movie that came out last year? That’s right, you don’t. The only way you saw that movie was if you visited your grandma at the old folks home on movie day."
Taylor Tomlinson,Can you really call it an address if he can barely read?
Taylor Tomlinson,"Luckily, Democrats stood up to him the only way they know how—by writing about it later in their diaries."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Like, you really shouldn’t stand up to fascism the same way we play Is It Caked? "
Taylor Tomlinson,"Trump could dig up FDR’s corpse, put makeup on it, and set it on fire, and Democrats would just hold up a little sign that says, ‘This violates norms.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Next we’ll see headings for ‘Can He Do That?,’ and then ‘Uh Oh, He Did That.’ Followed up by ’10 New Recipes to Spice Up Your Gruel.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, it’s not gonna be another Great Depression, it’s just gonna be a Great Adjustment Period. It’s fine! We’re not in an economic collapse, we’re just micro-dosing starvation."
Michael Kosta,"Democrats showed up in full wardrobe, dressed in pink as a symbolic protest against people who wanted them to do something meaningful."
Michael Kosta,"Yeaaah. You know, theres something kind of badass about shaking a cane at someone, right? ‘Don’t f*ck with me unless you want to take this very slowly outside.'"
Michael Kosta,"I’ve gotta say, props to this guy. He got to send a message to Donald Trump and go home early."
Michael Kosta,"Careful, you guys. The last time Republicans got this rowdy at the Capitol, Nancy Pelosi had to bleach her desk."
Michael Kosta,"First of all, I think it is normal at this point. Trump has been in our lives for a decade now—sadly, this is our normal. In the same way that 20 years ago it wasn’t normal to drunkenly jump in the back seat of a strangers car, but now it’s called Uber."
Michael Kosta,I can’t believe we’re paying that many people Social Security! I can’t believe it because it’s not true.
Michael Kosta,"‘I don’t get why everybody I’ve been bullying for ten years never smiles at me. Why don’t you like me, you limp-d*cked lunatics?'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"This year for Lent, we are giving up democracy."
Jimmy Kimmel,His speech was 10 minutes longer than The Lion King —and had twice as much lyin’ in it.
Jimmy Kimmel,Do you know how many times Trump lied during his speech last night? 11 million. Three fact-checkers died adding it up.
Jimmy Kimmel,Do you think they know this and just ignore it? Or maybe they’re so dumb they don’t know how to Google. Or maybe they think we’re so dumb we don’t know how to Google.
Jimmy Kimmel,"They’re just trying to cure dementia and heart disease, which you think Trump would be for, since they are both coming for him real soon."
Jimmy Kimmel,That is the Vermont version of a diss track. Bernie is like Kendrick Lamar in orthopedic shoes.
Jimmy Kimmel,"‘National security reasons?’ I know he had a plane—did Jeffrey Epstein have a UFO they flew on, too?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Let’s be honest, the reason this is taking so long is because Trump and Jeffrey Epstein spent more time on planes together than the Wright Brothers."
Jimmy Kimmel,They will release Diddy before they release all the Epstein files unredacted.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I mean, if that’s good enough to fire somebody, Grok him up."
Stephen Colbert,"The Wall Street Journal said he was starting ‘the dumbest trade war in history.’ Yes, it’s clearly the worst trade since third grade, when Timmy traded his Dunkaroos for an apple. Smooth move, nerd!"
Stephen Colbert,"But who better to gamble that a guy who somehow bankrupted his own casino. I’m kidding, obviously—it was multiple casinos."
Stephen Colbert,Which is why they’ve had to update their slogan from ‘Expect more. Pay less.’ To ‘Pay more. Shut up.'
Stephen Colbert,"‘None of that pause stuff! That thing when you pause for even a second and all those thoughts come into your head. And they’re telling you you’re a dumb guy, that don’t you don’t know what you’re doing. Like your dad always said when he’d wake you up and scream, ‘You’re a putz, Howard, you’re a stain on the Lutnick name, you’re the reason your mom ran away with Uncle Morty.’ We’re not doin’ that pause stuff!'"
Stephen Colbert,"‘What I mean is, we’re doin’ the pause stuff. I love the pause. We’re all about the pause. I’m part of a group of men who love to pause—I am in men-o-pause.'"
Stephen Colbert,‘Have fun?’ Those farmers need foreign countries to buy our crops because Americans can’t possibly jam any more corn into our high fruct-hole. America’s already at Defcon Corn.
Stephen Colbert,"Yeah it’s awesome! And it’s so easy to do. And if you can’t afford a chicken, you can just grow your own. First, you’ll need an egg—dammit!"
Stephen Colbert,"Just like how during Covid, the CDC told us to wipe down our groceries with live bats."
Stephen Colbert,"Now that, my friends, is good business. Sure you’re down 300 bucks, but on the plus side, chickens die easily, poop everywhere, and attract coyotes to your swing set."
Jimmy Fallon,"Adrien Brody was like, ‘Game respect game.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"During his address, Trump declared that America ‘will be woke no longer.’ And after 100 minutes of him speaking, no one was."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was like, ‘Not true. Elon Musk is my man date.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was confused by the paddles. He was like, ‘We’re not auctioning off Greenland until later.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Right now Drake is like, ‘Oh no.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Police in Florida said that a man allegedly stole and then ate nearly 800 thousand dollars worth of diamonds. A few hours later, his toilet said, ‘Yes, yes! 800 thousand times yes!'"
