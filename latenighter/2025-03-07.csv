Seth Meyers,Is this a presidential address or a voicemail from my mother?
Seth Meyers,"You want them to smile? So now the Democrats are getting catcalled by the president. ‘Hey-o, Democrats, you got a pretty face. How ’bout you give us a smile, baby!'"
Seth Meyers,That’s the silver lining? I need to start taking care of chickens now?
Seth Meyers,"I don’t want to be a farmer! I mean, look at me. The only thing a farmer and I have in common is that we both overdo it on the plaid."
Seth Meyers,"There is no clearer sign that someone is a psychopath than saying, ‘I love you, too,’ when nobody said, ‘I love you.'"
Seth Meyers,A hundred thousand dollars! That’s like six eggs.
Seth Meyers,"‘We love the word ‘tariff.’ You know why? Because ‘t’ stands for Trump, ‘a’ is the grade I give myself, and I live to riff. My favorite riff—Arnold Palmer’s got a big old wang.'"
Seth Meyers,They’re ‘not fit to have a job right now’ and ‘not willing to come to work?’ They served in the military in war zones. The guy you work for spends most of his time haunting golf courses like the ghost of a guy who got eaten by a crocodile on the 12th hole.
Michael Kosta,‘It’s a beautiful word. That’s why I named my daughter Tariffany.'
Michael Kosta,"This guy is so horny for tariffs, isn’t he? ‘I love any word with big natural double ‘f’s.'"
Michael Kosta,"By the way, who thinks the word recession is offensive, finance bros? Did they get woke? ‘Before we discuss the impending r-word, we begin by acknowledging that we are on the ancestral grounds of the Capitol Grille, where Chad was unjustly removed by the bartender before he could get a chance to cheat on his wife.'"
Michael Kosta,"Yeah, nonsense! ‘It’s not inflation, people, it’s just higher prices on food and cars and gas, and every other product we import from our biggest trading partners.'"
Michael Kosta,"Wait, wait, wait, after all that, tariffs are on hold? Trump just backed away from those tariffs like it was a longtime friendship with Jeffrey Epstein."
Michael Kosta,"Oh sh*t. China? China don’t play. They’re like, ‘If you’ve got beef, we’ve got broccoli, b*tch, let’s go.'"
Michael Kosta,"Listen Donald, Canada and Mexico are one thing, but please don’t piss off China. I know you wrote The Art of the Deal , but they wrote The Art of War ."
Stephen Colbert,"So tariffs may raise prices and hurt American consumers, but we must have them, for they protect the soul of our country! Until today."
Stephen Colbert,"‘Frankly folks, souls are overrated. I sold mine years ago in exchange for the ability to do anything I want with zero repercussions.'"
Stephen Colbert,That is the sound of Tesla sales plummeting.
Stephen Colbert,That’s the kind of heart-stopping urgency that’s a strategy known as ‘your mom texting you at 7 a.m.’ ‘Please call me… prayer hands emoji.'
Stephen Colbert,No. ‘Disruption’ is when your cable goes out during a storm. This is your cable guy burning your house to the ground—between the hours of noon and 6 p.m. on Thursday.
Stephen Colbert,You’re firing fifteen percent of your workers! At least give them the courtesy of a second take.
Stephen Colbert,"But you know the DOGE motto: If it ain’t broke, let me try!"
Stephen Colbert,"Oops-a-DOGE-y!” on plans to sell off government buildings, including the HQ of the general services administration—which oversees selling government properties"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, millions of young people cannot stand Elon Musk. And those are just his kids."
Stephen Colbert,And that’s Wisconsin. Those are some of the nicest people in America. Normally the only way to get them that mad is to tell them they’re not allowed to drink on a snowmobile.
Stephen Colbert,"With fury rising, yesterday congressional Republicans called Musk to Capitol Hill where they took a firm stance against this unelected oligarch—and ‘gently questioned him.’ Yes, the GOP is using that classic strategy, good cop-nicer cop. ‘Hey you’re better off talking to me, buddy, because when my partner comes in here, he’s bringing lemon bars—and they are exquisite.'"
Stephen Colbert,"For once I agree with you, sir."
Jimmy Fallon,It is tough news for all the Spring Breakers who booked a trip to Nova Scotia.
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, Canada is now no longer selling bottles of Jack Daniel’s, Fireball, and Tito’s Vodka. Or as Democrats are currently calling it, breakfast."
Jimmy Fallon,"When asked how he describes his economic policy, Trump said, ‘Basically, I just keep hitting snooze.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Say what you want about the tariffs, but no one has suffered more than the guy who owns a combination Taco Bell-Tim Hortons-Panda Express."
Jimmy Fallon,"Tickets cost $200, wait $50, wait $120, wait… now it’s nothing. It’s worth nothing."
Jimmy Fallon,"America was like, ‘That’s great news—wait, what do they know?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Staffers were like, ‘Well I pulled my kids out of college, sold my house, but other than that no harm done.'"
Jimmy Fallon,It is tough news for all the Spring Breakers who switched their flights from Nova Scotia to North Korea.
Jimmy Fallon,They’ll eventually reopen to tourism when Trump makes North Korea the 52nd state.
Jimmy Fallon,Netflix just announced their second live boxing event. And I honestly think Jake Paul has a pretty good chance against Dick Van Dyke.
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s right, WWE co-founder Linda McMahon will supervise the important work of dismantling the Department of Education. Good for him though. Another genius tactical move, I’ll tell you why. He keeps getting attacked by all these smart people, so what does he do? He outlaws smart."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Of course it’s also a win for Linda McMahon. The less educated we are, the more likely we are to believe that wrestling is real."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Their plan, they say, is to turn control over education to the states. In other words, bad news Mississippi, your kids aren’t going to be able to spell Mississippi any more."
Jimmy Kimmel,"At this point, even Putin’s like, ‘Hey reel it in a little. You’re making this a little too obvious.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Our co-president Elon Musk has endorsed the idea of the U.S. pulling out of both NATO and the United Nations. Which is big because Elon Musk, you know, he has 14 kids—he doesn’t ever pull out of anything."
Jimmy Kimmel,I don’t think we need to finish the wall. I think this administration’s already doing a pretty good job of making sure no one wants to live here.
Jimmy Kimmel,They might have to build a wall to keep us in at this point.
Jimmy Kimmel,"It will be replaced by a production of Kanye West Side Story , followed by an all-white production of The Wiz ."
Jimmy Kimmel,And this is a painstaking process for Canadians because they apologize to each bottle as they remove it from the shelf.
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s like we suddenly got hooked on meth and went to the apartment upstairs, you know? ‘You got any money?'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"If you are in the market for a new or gently used frittata, Facebook is the place right now."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Luigi Mangione is the name of the accused murderer of a healthcare CEO whose name was… ahhh, he’s not hot, so I can’t remember."
Taylor Tomlinson,Luigi won everybody’s hearts when he was the target of a widespread manhunt. Which is also a great title for these videos.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Like what the f*ck, let the girl eat! This is a date, why are you treating this like a police interrogation. Like, ‘Yeah, you’ll get to eat—once you tell me how many siblings you have!'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Look, this is bad, but at least he didn’t waste her time. I mean, most guys can take two, even three dates to admit they want to kill you. Hell, some guys try to starve you on the first date."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Also, the guy says, ‘depends if you’re gonna cancel me or not.’ Bro, here’s a tip—you can’t be cancelled if nobody gives a sh*t who you are. All of these random losers like, ‘I’m gonna get cancelled!’ It’s like, cancelled for what, j*rking off in your mom’s attic?"
