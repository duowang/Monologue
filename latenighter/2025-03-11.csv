Seth Meyers,"I love how Fox hosts have to talk to Trump when he says something insane. They can’t just say, ‘That’s not true,’ so they repeat his own words back to him with a raised eyebrow. That’s how you talk to your fianceé’s parents the first time you meet them. ‘Oh, so you think the Super Bowl halftime show was a DEI plot to indoctrinate America with wokeness?'"
Seth Meyers,"Now to be fair, Trump only said the stock market would crash if Biden won. He didn’t say it would do well if he won. For all we knew his point was, ‘Look Maria, it’s gonna eat sh*t either way, so let’s have some fun and get a crazy person back in the Oval Office.'"
Seth Meyers,"I’m starting to feel like the ‘business’ in Fox Business is the same as the business in monkey business. It doesn’t mean ‘things of an economic manner’ but ‘shenanigans!’ I’m gonna start telling my kids, ‘We’re having dinner at a fancy restaurant tonight, and I won’t stand for any fox business!'"
Seth Meyers,"‘You can’t really watch the stock market?’ That’s all you’ve talked about for years. What do you want us to watch instead? ‘Maria, it’s a mistake to watch the stock market when you should be watching Severance . What a show, it’s a great show.'"
Seth Meyers,"‘But they are the politest cartels we’ve ever had to deal with. The Canadian cartels are so polite. ‘Hey, welcome to our drug lab, eh? Would you mind smokin’ a little meth to prove you’re not a cop, eh?'"
Seth Meyers,"So during the campaign you said you’d fix the economy on Day One, and now that you’re president you’ve turned into George R.R. Martin. ‘You guys, these things take time.'"
Seth Meyers,"‘It will be great for the farmers and, in a way, we’ll all become farmers. Because food will be so expensive, you’ll have to start growing vegetables in your back yard. My favorite vegetable, of course—the steak.'"
Seth Meyers,"Of course he did. Even when he’s doing a press conference with Elon, he looks like he’s in hour three of a match at Wimbledon."
Seth Meyers,"Trump wants everything to run smoothly until it gets boring, and then he wants chaos because it’s fun. He’s the kind of guy who would bring up politics at Thanksgiving just to get a rise out of everyone. ‘You know what, this has been a really great dinner. Too good in fact. What does everything think about the casting in the new Little Mermaid movie? Uncle Joe, you’ve had a few drinks, why don’t you go first.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Now I don’t know a lot of financial jargon, but let’s just say that your 401 is not ‘kay."
Stephen Colbert,That’s not the advice you get from your financial guy. That’s what the shaman says as he’s pouring the ayahuasca down your throat.
Stephen Colbert,"Do you know how hard it is to exhaust Wall Street? They wake up every morning to a hot cup of cocaine, and then—just to take the edge off—more cocaine."
Stephen Colbert,"In the first Trump term, it took a disease to destroy the economy. This time, he is the disease."
Stephen Colbert,"Oh sure, with a big enough time perspective, nothing really matters. ‘Beth, I can tell you are mad that I’m two hours late to our wedding. But I remind you, on a geological scale, two hours is punctual. Does a mountain care that I got distracted by looking at sandwiches on TikTok?'"
Stephen Colbert,"The supposed reason Trump killed DEI in government is because he wants to hire on merit only. Like his merit hire at Defense, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. One of the top three weekend Fox & Friends hosts currently shotgunning a mini bottle of Fireball."
Stephen Colbert,He’s less DEI and more DUI.
Stephen Colbert,A list clearly made by men who have experience barriers having sex with women.
Stephen Colbert,It has been replaced with a photo of the famous Enola Your Uncle’s Longtime Roommate.
Taylor Tomlinson,It really is giving straight guy at the lesbian bar.
Taylor Tomlinson,"If you have a Cybertruck, stay out of parades, they’re too controversial. That’s why the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade doesn’t have a giant inflatable Kevin Spacey."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Obviously, Cybertrucks are ugly. I think people who like them are into all the weird corners. Maybe because they’re the type of people who like to corner you at a party."
Taylor Tomlinson,"He’s abandoned his companies so hard, you’d think it was one of his kids."
Taylor Tomlinson,"I think putting tariffs in place that affect Elon is a great idea, which is why I’m proposing a tariff on hair plugs."
Taylor Tomlinson,The main takeaway here is that Tesla is imploding. Which must be so hard on Elon because he usually prefers exploding .
Taylor Tomlinson,"That picture is hilarious. It’s like when a douchebag wears a bracelet that says feminist. You can’t just slap on a label, I can still see the rest of you."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was like, ‘Depends if we use my economic policies from this morning or this afternoon.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"But we’re in good hands. If anyone knows how to fight a recession, it’s Elon Musk."
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s not great when the summary of your first two months in office is ‘stocks down, measles up.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Dairy prices don’t affect Trump because most of the cheese that he uses comes in Whiz form.
Jimmy Fallon,"It was rough, all day long users had to get their disinformation from Facebook."
Jimmy Fallon,"On the bright side, usually when you hear about a Tesla plunge it’s when it drives itself into a river."
Jimmy Kimmel,I tried something different this year. I set my clocks ahead four years. Didn’t work.
Jimmy Kimmel,"We go forward, we go back. It’s like living in a Christopher Nolan movie."
Jimmy Kimmel,"We have Donald Trump firing air traffic controllers, screwing up our national parks, threatening to annex Canada, focusing on all these dumb things. And not just dumb things—unpopular things. Why not focus on a dumb popular thing?"
Jimmy Kimmel,He dresses like the first person eliminated from the World Series of Poker.
Jimmy Kimmel,[Trump] really has turned this into The Celebrity Appresident .
Jimmy Kimmel,"Poor little Marco. He used to be this powerful senator, now he’s first mate on the Spraytanic."
Jimmy Kimmel,"And you’re next, bi-planes, you’ll see."
