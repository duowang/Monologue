Stephen Colbert,"Yesterday the Dow tripped on Trump’s tariffs and fell down an elevator shaft. And today it kept bonking its head on the way down, plunging more than 400 points."
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, Maria, Maria, Maria, that excuse is getting harder and harder to bake. ‘You goin’ in the bathroom? You better give it a minute—Joe Biden was in there about eight weeks ago.'"
Stephen Colbert,"And that’s a shame, because Canadian electricity is clean energy. It’s powered by pure, natural ‘beaver in a big wheel.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, day one! Make American affordable again. Or MAAA. And soon, that is the sound you’ll make when you open your electric bill."
Stephen Colbert,You know things are on the right track when your explanation involves the phrase ‘blood everywhere.'
Stephen Colbert,"And I’m no doctor, and not to quibble, but if there’s blood shootin’ out, maybe it’s not time to rip the Band-Aid off. Maybe it’s time to put on a second Band-Aid. Or, call me crazy, maybe bring in somebody who knows how to fix the old blood-hole. Instead of trusting the guy with the hat that says Make America Blood Everywhere."
Stephen Colbert,"Ha ha! Good one, Heinrich Giggler."
Stephen Colbert,And there’s a good reason for that. It’s a phenomenon called ‘everybody f*cking hates that guy.'
Stephen Colbert,"How do you illegally boycott something? Buying things is optional. That’s why, when you walk into a West Elm, they don’t lock the door and say, ‘You want out? Then buy a fat candle with three wicks in it. Or five rattan balls in a wicker basket designed to give you splinters. You wanna clean it? You can’t. Now give me $80 or I’m callin’ the cops.'"
Stephen Colbert,"You’re right Mr. President, ‘everything is computer.’ Which is also the name of the Russian knockoff of The Matrix ."
Stephen Colbert,"But you know what, it’s an honest mistake. He just mixed up the two words most associated with Elon Musk, Tesla and Hitler."
Stephen Colbert,You can’t get measles by eating garbage 24 hours a day. You know how I know that? I don’t have measles.
Stephen Colbert,"So really, it’s not measles… it’s we-sles."
Stephen Colbert,"Maybe so, but that’s not causin’ the measles. Those are two separate issues. ‘Honey, I know I cheated on you, but you have to understand—West Texas is a food desert.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, public health is every man for himself. That’s why those signs on the highway say, ‘Don’t drink and drive—unless it’s your birthday week! Go off, queen!'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s moving on Canada like a bitch , and no one’s stopping him."
Jimmy Kimmel,This is how Jafar from Aladdin tried to mate with Princess Jasmine. Jafar-a-Lago here.
Jimmy Kimmel,And that’s how delusional you have to be to marry Eric Trump.
Jimmy Kimmel,She believes Donald Trump and Elon Musk are gonna save the world. She also believes she can sing.
Jimmy Kimmel,He’s finally turned into the used car salesman we always knew he was all along.
Jimmy Kimmel,He flip-flops from zero to sixty in under five seconds.
Jimmy Fallon,"In response to President Trump’s tariffs, Canada threatened to shut off electricity from multiple U.S. states, including New York. Trump may not care now, but he will if his tanning bed only goes up to ‘lightly crisp.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Can you imagine New York City without electricity? I mean, if you ride the subway you can, but for everyone else."
Jimmy Fallon,Right now the economy is so bad [that] Elon Musk is thinking about laying off Donald Trump.
Jimmy Fallon,"People are saying Trump doesn’t know anything about the economy and they might have a point. I mean, he thinks bear markets are where RFK Jr buys his lunch meat."
Jimmy Fallon,"I’m not kidding, ‘ duopoly ‘ is who Trump thinks is the artist who sings ‘Dance the Night Away’ and ‘Levitating.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Trump thinks an endowment is what that dad in The White Lotus showed under his robe last night.
Jimmy Fallon,"After the market severely dropped yesterday, Trump spent the night glued to Truth Social as he posted over 100 times in six hours. Yeah, smart. Nothing calms people down like manic posting on social media."
Jimmy Fallon,"100 posts in six hours. Don Jr was like, ‘I’ll snort what he’s snorting.'"
Seth Meyers,"President Trump yesterday signed more executive orders. In related news, Happy National Wet T-Shirt Day."
Seth Meyers,"President Trump signed a proclamation last week declaring March as Women’s History Month and added, ‘Women have done a lot for us.’ In fact, sometimes they do so much, you have to pay them 130,000 dollars in hush money."
Seth Meyers,"President Trump said last week he’s considering imposing sanctions and tariffs on Russia. ‘No you’re not,’ said the plant in his office."
Seth Meyers,Which means we’re all gonna be paying a little bit more for our… caviar? I can’t pay more for caviar and eggs. My caviar omelettes are already so expensive.
Seth Meyers,"And to the Count, now’s not the time."
Seth Meyers,You ever notice how it’s only super-wealthy people who want to live longer. That’s why anti-aging treatments are a quarter-million dollars but a Taco Supreme Lux Box is $5.99. ‘Here’s a ten—take me out.'
Seth Meyers,"Panera Bread announced that it will offer a green version of its famous bread bowl in honor of St. Patrick’s Day. The way it works is, they just leave it out over night."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Kash Patel is the FBI director now. But you may remember him as the producer of a song by the January 6 rioters. It’s called ‘Justice for All,’ and I won’t play it right now. But I’ve heard it and it really should be called ‘Voice Lessons for Some.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Patel is a lawyer and conspiracy theorist who also wrote a children’s book called The Plot Against the King . Which is much less on-the-nose than his original title, Oh, the Capitols You’ll Storm! "
Taylor Tomlinson,"He is one of Trump’s most controversial appointments, which is really saying something. Because I think he made the Secretary of Transportation a wiener dog sitting in a fancy purse."
Taylor Tomlinson,"What are they gonna do, put tax evaders in a headlock?"
Taylor Tomlinson,Being a good fighter doesn’t make you good at catching criminals. Just like having a brain worm doesn’t make you good at understanding medicine.
Taylor Tomlinson,"If this picture doesn’t make you feel safe, you must really have eyes and memory."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Just because you enjoy something for entertainment doesn’t mean it’s good for your employees. Like, is Kash Patel also going to do team building exercises at a strip club? ‘Yeah, it’s like doing trust falls because I trust nobody is gonna tell my wife what happened in the VIP room.'"
