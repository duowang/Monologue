name,monologue
Seth Meyers,"That’s like me saying, ‘How dare you test my knowledge of modern rap?’ after I boldly proclaimed that the Kendrick/Drake feud is currently too close to call.'"
Seth Meyers,"That’s right, Elon Musk has lost billions of dollars. It’s gotten so bad, he can only afford to wear the one outfit. That’s why it always looks like he was dropped naked into a Hot Topic with only $80 to spend."
Seth Meyers,"Although, you guys, that might just be because in Australia, Tesla is also the name of a weird, dangerous bird. [Australian accent] ‘I’d like to order a Tesla, please.’ ‘You don’t want one of those mate—two beaks, each one sharper than the next!'"
Seth Meyers,"And also, I’m sorry, the home of Mad Max can’t be into electric cars. [Picture of Fury Road ’s Immortan Joe] Nobody wants to see this guy screaming into a microphone, ‘Find me the nearest charging station!'"
Seth Meyers,I have an idea. How about a vanity acronym. Something like Making Incredible Changes in Reviving the Office of the President.
Seth Meyers,"You know, I give the man a hard time. But then he says something that really puts things in perspective. Because, when you really think about it, everything’s computers."
Seth Meyers,"Sounds like a very lazy pitch for a sci-fi movie. ‘Guy’s in a coma, all right? He wakes up 30, 40 years later—everything’s computer.'"
Seth Meyers,"Yeah, a car is a golf cart that goes really fast. Is that how they have to explain things to Trump in the Situation Room? ‘Mister President, we’ve deployed a tactical battalion of F-16 fighter jets to the region.’ ‘And if I may step in, Mister President, the F-16 is like a golf cart with wings that shoots missiles.'"
Seth Meyers,"Immigration agents arrested a legal permanent resident with a green card who is married to an American citizen without even charging him with a crime. Meanwhile, a guy who was actually convicted of 34 felony counts is currently palling around in a Tesla on the White House lawn."
Seth Meyers,"Which is just a terrifying photo. It looks the the two kinds of men you see in Miami—a weird old businessman and a creep in sunglasses. ‘Hey ladies, you wanna check out my—it’s like a golf cart but faster.'"
Stephen Colbert,"But today, Trump implemented a plan to quell fear of tariffs—with more tariffs. Now remember, you’ve gotta fight fire with setting our money on fire."
Stephen Colbert,Aluminum? Foiled again!” on new tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum
Stephen Colbert,That’s fine. We don’t need to send swimming pools to Canada. We know they’re just gonna freeze them and do a hockey on there.
Stephen Colbert,"So kind. Just like those Hallmark cards, ‘Happy birthday to the dumbest grandson in history—and that’s being kind.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, he clearly only understands things in chickenomics. ‘America is the chicken, the money is the bucket, the market is coleslaw, and when you order a four-piece tenders combo, they give you Canada in a little cup.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, these tariffs are the most important things America has ever had. More important than the Declaration of Independence. More important than landing on the moon. More important than making the taco shell out of the Dorito."
Stephen Colbert,"You know someone is lying when they use that big of a superlative about anything. ‘How was my Vegas trip with the boys? Honey, let me just say that no husband in the world has ever come back with less chlamydia.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Oh, in that case, [puts on Groucho glasses] I think this is chaotic."
Stephen Colbert,"‘What? No student visa? Then we’re revoking your Sephora beauty insider card. No more free birthday samples for you, mister. Say hello to crow’s feet.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, if you don’t like that, you have a constitutional right to protest it. And, just by doing so, you could win a free trip to Louisiana! Laissez Les End Times Rouler!"
Stephen Colbert,"So he’s going to arrest anyone who disagrees with him? Even me, John Oliver? Blimey!"
Stephen Colbert,"If you think this will end with students, I’ve got a wall in Berlin to sell you."
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s his thing now. Any time a world leader shows up, right off the bat they have to apologize for whatever slight President Drama Queen has created in his head."
Jimmy Kimmel,This feud with Rosie’s been going on longer than me and Matt Damon now.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Putin will get a back rub if he ever comes, but the Irish Prime Minister gets a stubby little finger in his face."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Here’s a math problem, okay? If the Department of Education has 4,000 employees and the president cuts 50 percent of the workforce, how many edibles do I need to get through the next four years?"
Jimmy Kimmel,Could you imagine getting fired by the wife of the disgraced wrestling meathead? Don’t let the folding chair hit you on the way out.
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was asked who his favorite Irish person was and he said UFC fighter Conor McGregor . But you know his brain was like, ‘Is Ronald McDonald Irish or Scottish.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Today Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imported into the U.S., and the European Union retaliated with tariffs on beef, peanut butter, and whiskey. Or as it’s also known, the single dad food pyramid."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump just announced he’s firing 50 percent of the Department of Education. Even worse, Trump said, ‘Don’t worry, the other 60 percent will still have jobs.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Over the past few weeks, the billionaires who attended Trump’s inauguration have lost a combined $209 billion dollars. Yeah, it’s been a wild time, Elon Musk lost $150 billion. Jeff Bezos lost $29 billion. And Mark Zuckerberg lost his mind ."
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s not that the Roomba sucked, it’s just that it didn’t suck enough."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Wow, straight couples really will do anything to ask, ‘Are you a top or a bottom?"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, it’s nice. It looks as if Gwyneth Paltrow designed a prison cell."
Taylor Tomlinson,"This setup is great for when you’re married and you want to tell the world, ‘We really like it when people think we’re brother and sister.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"I do see the positives. You get a whole bed to yourselves, and if your partner snores, you can just kick ‘em from below like they’re your upstairs neighbors having a party."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Who is more isolated: people with children or people without? Ignoring the most important group of all, single hosts of late-night shows. Like, where’s my thinkpiece? I’m the only late-night host without a wife. That sucks."
Taylor Tomlinson,I read my contract way too fast. I thought I was gonna get James Corden’s time slot and his wife.
Taylor Tomlinson,"But everybody needs support whether you have kids or not. Like, if I have to do peek-a-boo with your kid, you occasionally have to do peek-a-boo with the dumb guy I’m dating. ‘Where’s Kevin? Where’s Kevin? There he is! He’s on a dirtbike!'"
