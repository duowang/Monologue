Seth Meyers,They claimed they saved eight billion but it was actually eight million. He added three zeroes. Which is also what Trump did when he had kids.
Seth Meyers,"I’d be pissed too if I were a member of the president’s cabinet, confirmed by the senate, vested with a statutory authority over a giant bureaucracy and White Morpheus over here tells me to fire air traffic controllers."
Seth Meyers,"Although I do love the naivety of a Trump official coming to a cabinet meeting and being shocked that things aren’t running smoothly. It’s like hiring your weed dealer as your babysitter and being surprised at the state of the house when you get home. ‘What in the hell happened here?’ ‘Uh, well, I read them The Lorax and then we all got super bummed out so I let them play with the chainsaw.'"
Seth Meyers,The vibe is so bad that the air dancer at Tesla dealerships are just standing straight up with their arms at their sides. And it’s really weird when they don’t move at a Tesla dealership because they run on air and Elon Musk blows.
Seth Meyers,"That interview by the way was on Newsmax. Newsmax, if you’re not familiar, is if Fox News had a crazy uncle."
Seth Meyers,"Also, it’s such a devastating criticism to say to someone, ‘We like what you’re doing, we just want to see less of you.’ It’s like if a friend was crashing at your place and you said, ‘We love having you as a guest but we were wondering if maybe you could sleep in the basement and not come out when we have our other friends over.'"
Seth Meyers,"Oh man. What a loud f*cking sigh. It’s rare to see a man this defeated on TV. He went from sounding like a motivational speaker to sounding like the Jets’ coach at a post-game press conference. ‘Yeah, uh [long sigh] we’re just trying to be more efficient. Maybe we’ll just cut the quarterback position entirely.'"
Seth Meyers,"Musk doesn’t have Trump’s ability to pretend that everything’s going great. If Trump were in charge of Musk’s company he’d be saying, ‘We’re selling more Teslas than ever before, SpaceX just landed on Neptune, now we’re going straight to the sun—we’re gonna blow up the sun. No more solar panels, no more green new scam, no more woke. No more woke because the sun will never be out, you’ll always be asleep.'"
Seth Meyers,"‘I love Tesler’ sounds like a sitcom about the neighborhood nerd. ‘Honey, did Tesler do a science experiment that turned the cat into a dog?'"
Seth Meyers,"Oh yeah, these people definitely sound like they’re gonna buy a Tesla. ‘I know I told you electric vehicles cost to much and they don’t go far and they don’t work in the cold and they use too much electricity and if you drive one you’ll get stuck in the desert and possibly die, but you should help out Elon and buy one. Poor guy, he’s got so many kids he doesn’t know what to do. New one shows up every day—where was I? Oh yeah, go out and buy a Tesler!'"
Stephen Colbert,"Now I want to be clear, I do not condone violence or vandalism of any kind. That is a deeply held belief of mine that comes from the bottom of my CBS legal department."
Stephen Colbert,"To be fair, that might not be vandalism, that might be a simple mistake, because they do look an awful lot like a dumpster."
Stephen Colbert,"Whoever did it, I do not condone this, but I do appreciate your tire-less efforts."
Stephen Colbert,"It’s so bad on Wall Street, the bull just applied for a job at Chipotle. He’s hoping to get an internship as a taco."
Stephen Colbert,"And I believe on Easter, they’ll rise again."
Stephen Colbert,Which means it may be finally time to switch to Grade B eggs. You know their slogan: ‘Do they all have to be from chickens?'
Stephen Colbert,That is gonna make it so much harder for European men to have a midlife crisis. You can’t outrun your mortality on a Vespa.
Stephen Colbert,"So get ready to toast the next New Year’s with America’s finest sparkling beverage, Champagne Code Red."
Stephen Colbert,"The new highway to a Mad Max hellscape was announced by EPA administrator and Humpty Dumpty after Ozempic, Lee Zeldin."
Stephen Colbert,"Mercury poisoning is back, baby! Pretty soon your horoscope is going to read, ‘This month, Mercury is in retrograde and also in your brain, blaaaaaaggahhhaa.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency is to protect the environment, not to sell cheaper cars. Selling used cars is the mission of Lee Zeldin’s Used Auto World."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know, there was a time when firing people was the only thing Donald Trump was good at."
Jimmy Kimmel,"According to a new poll from CNN, 56 percent of disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy. And that was before Trump turned the White House into a Tesla showroom."
Jimmy Kimmel,That is very unfair. He’s making it very expensive to get drunk—he’s the reason we need to get drunk.
Jimmy Kimmel,Has a quid ever been pro quo-ed more than this one?
Jimmy Kimmel,"The guy in charge of government efficiency just spent $100 million to sell Trump a $90,000 car."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Only 35 percent of Americans have a positive view of Elon Musk, 53 percent view him negatively, and 12 percent felt it would be inappropriate to respond because they are currently pregnant with one of his children."
Jimmy Fallon,That’s a lot. It’s almost enough to make you feel bad for people who buy champagne and wine.
Jimmy Fallon,"People who buy champagne and wine are like, ‘What’s next, a tariff on caviar and truffles?'"
Jimmy Fallon,Trump’s playing a dangerous game. Nobody want’s to attend a Mike’s Hard Lemonade and cheese party.
Jimmy Fallon,It’s stuff like this that makes people question his state.
Jimmy Fallon,"People were like, ‘What about the artificial line between the United States and Mexico?,’ and Trump was like, ‘No, that one’s real.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Canada was like, ‘Aww, if you guys want, you can be our eleventh province.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Our government could stop functioning. Yeah, it’s big news. Apparently our government has been functioning."
Taylor Tomlinson,"‘Maybe they’ll love each other?’ You’re supposed to be rescuing them, not writing fan fiction about them."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Also, being stuck with someone for a long time doesn’t make you fall in love, Donald. Just ask Melania."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Also, living with a man does not make you fall in love with them. Living with a man is disgusting. Can you imagine how much worse it is in zero gravity? You think you hate seeing his pubes in the sink, wait ’til they’re floating in the air."
Taylor Tomlinson,"She’s a Navy officer with a masters of science and he’s like, ‘the woman with the crazy hair.’ That’s like calling Albert Einstein ‘the tongue guy.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,Trump said he also asked Elon Musk to ‘go pick those astronauts up.’ Which is pretty rich coming from two guys who have never picked their kids up from school.
Taylor Tomlinson,"It’s weird to see some of these games next to each other on a list. Like, what do Tamagotchis have in common with Call of Duty ? Besides how they both make tweens say, ‘Don’t die on me you little bitch!'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"NBA2K is also on this list. You may not know this, but this game is actually huge for the LGBTQ community, because many women realized they were bisexual while watching their boyfriends play it."
