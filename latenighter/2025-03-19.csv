Jordan Klepper,"My God. I mean, if you had told me that Donald Trump would trigger a constitutional crisis just seven weeks into his term, I would have said, ‘That is a lot later than I thought.'"
Jordan Klepper,"Is that how rulings work? You have to put it writing, you can’t just say it? Well, this is definitely not the first time Trump has defended himself by arguing that oral doesn’t count."
Jordan Klepper,"Apparently, the Constitution is not in effect over international waters. That explains Carnival Cruise Lines new ship, the SS Cruel and Unusual Punishment."
Jordan Klepper,"So there you have it. Donald Trump went from, ‘Oh sorry, we would have listened to this judge if we would have heard it in time,’ to, ‘Actually, this lunatic judge should be impeached.’ And if you would have told me that that all happened in 48 hours, I would have said, ‘Wow, again, longer than I would have expected.'"
Jordan Klepper,"It’s not enough that he’s fighting the judicial branch in the present, he’s fighting the executive branch in the past. He’s causing more problems in the multiverse than Jonathan Majors."
Jordan Klepper,"Thomas Jefferson? I mean, I guess that makes sense. When you’ve got that many secret kids, that’s a lot of birthday cards that you’ve got to sign."
Jordan Klepper,"Yes, good question. Did Joe Biden really sign the pardons that he said several times he signed? Or did a radical left lunatic sneak into the Oval Office and start signing whatever was in the room? Pardons, laws, doctor’s notes, yearbooks? I mean, did Joe Biden really want Cindy to have a great summer, or was it the deep state?"
Jordan Klepper,"‘Yeah, if I’m doing important things like pardoning January 6-ers, I’ll sign it myself. But for doing stupid sh*t like signing letters to sick kids, Docusign is fine.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Today Donald Trump had a nearly three-hour phone call with Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine. Although Trump spent most of that time trying to sell Putin a Cybertruck.
Jimmy Fallon,But both sides said the call went well which makes sense since they’re both on the same side.
Jimmy Fallon,"When asked why, Putin said, ‘Because it’s funny.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"The CEO of Ferrari said that the company’s clients are getting younger, with 40 percent of their new customers under the age of 40. Still small penises, but under the age of 40."
Jimmy Fallon,Doctors are concerned about a growing trend of people going under anesthesia when they get tattoos. Doctors prefer the safe traditional method of getting blackout drunk.
Jimmy Kimmel,Of course he loves Cats . It’s the one musical where the pussies grab you.
Jimmy Kimmel,"That would be so great. Him hosting an awards show, me at home tweeting insults while he does it."
Jimmy Kimmel,There are gonna be some big surprises. Lauren Boebert’s going to go around to all the seats to make sure everyone has fun.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Kennedy Center is finally great again. Next up, the Holocaust Museum—very one-sided right now."
Jimmy Kimmel,Putting Trump on the phone with Putin is like putting your grandma on the phone with a Nigerian prince.
Jimmy Kimmel,People keep asking if Trump is getting played by Putin. Which is like asking if ‘Hava Nagila’ is getting played at a bar mitzvah.
Jimmy Kimmel,"But that’s Kanye. When everyone else zigs, he sieg heils."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Republicans finally came up with a plan for healthcare, and this is it."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump derangement syndrome. Which, by the way, is a very serious condition. But many people who suffer from it can lead happy, productive lives. Some even host their own late-night talk shows."
