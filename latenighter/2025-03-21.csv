Jordan Klepper,"Yes, yes! The more that you say something is real, the more people believe you. ‘My real, real girlfriend lives in real Canada. She’s not just sort of my girlfriend, she’s my real girlfriend. She’s real and I touched her real boobies.'"
Jordan Klepper,"Whoah, man. It looks like 304-55-6622 is really upset about that leak. Social Security numbers, addresses, full names—the only thing that wasn’t in the JFK papers was who killed JFK."
Jordan Klepper,"Trump’s poor, poor lawyer. He’s probably like, ‘I never would have represented you in your 2020 election fraud case if I knew you’d be untrustworthy.'"
Jordan Klepper,"‘Yeah, don’t blame us, blame our racist software.We should have never used ChatKKK.'"
Jordan Klepper,"That’s how lazy they were with this. They just Control-F-ed for gay sounding keywords and deleted anything that showed up. Now kids won’t know anything about the Enola Gay, they won’t know about transport planes, and they won’t know about the heroic service of Captain Grindr McScissoring."
Jordan Klepper,What’s really tragic is they could have avoided all this if they’d just named the plane Enola Gay No Homo.
Jordan Klepper,"Yeah! You hear that, people who don’t buy a $30,000 robot that isn’t on the market yet and will probably strangle you in your sleep? You’re gonna look silly."
Jordan Klepper,These poor everyday Fox viewers must be so confused. They came here for the xenophobia and the pretty ladies and now they have to mortgage their house to get a robot with a thigh gap.
Jordan Klepper,"Nice! Pretty soon, even Fox is going to stop saying, ‘Merry Christmas,’ and replace it with ‘Happy Tesla December to Remember Sales Event.'"

Jimmy Kimmel,"They’re like, ‘Hey kids, who hates school?’ And they’re like, ‘We do.’ And they’re like, ‘Good news, it’s over.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"For instance, from here on, to receive a high school diploma in Florida, all you have to do is complete the maze on the back of the kids’ menu at Fuddruckers."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Right, Jackie Robinson was just a baseball player. There’s nothing special about him. Rosa Parks just loved to ride the bus."
Jimmy Kimmel,Imagine how racist you have to be to be racist against Jackie Robinson… today.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I mentioned last night, multiple Teslas were burned at a Tesla facility in Las Vegas. Authorities are now investigating which Teslas were set on fire and which set themselves on fire."
Jimmy Kimmel,"But the MAGA gang, which has been very against any sort of violent protest ever since January… seventh, was it?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"‘But if you try to taser a cop on the steps of the Capitol, we’ve got your back, don’t worry about that.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Today just so happens to be Barron’s birthday. He turns 19 years old today, which means Trump’s affair with Stormy Daniels just turned 18 years old and eight months."
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s dangerous. I mean, if the roof blows off, people could see you in a Cybertruck."
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s a historic move that, years from now, kids will not read about in history textbooks."
Jimmy Fallon,"When the Diet Coke didn’t show up, he was like, ‘Maybe that was the nuclear button. Oops.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Meanwhile, Cracker Barrel was like, ‘We shouldn’t…'"
