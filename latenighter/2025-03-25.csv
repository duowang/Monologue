Jimmy Kimmel,"In other words, our national security is being guarded by a bunch of doofs you wouldn’t trust to throw your cousin a surprise party."
Jimmy Kimmel,"No one on the group chat thought to ask, ‘Who is J.G. What are these initials?’ They could have been leaking state secrets to Jeff Goldblum for all they know."
Jimmy Kimmel,"My God, if Joe Biden’s top military team accidentally texted these plans to a journalist, Laura Ingraham’s erection would be so rock-strong it would break through the wall like the Kool-Aid man."
Jimmy Kimmel,"‘If you read the content of these massages?’ The point is, we’re not supposed to read the content of these messages!"
Jimmy Kimmel,"You hear that, China? Our planes go up to 47 now. It’s Spinal Tap , the administration."
Jimmy Kimmel,‘F-47’ sounds like a vanity plate you’d get if you wanted everybody to know you don’t like Donald Trump.
Jimmy Kimmel,I agree with him on this one. It’s not a very good likeness. I mean look how inaccurate the skin color is. The skin is the color of skin.
Jon Stewart,"Oopsie-poopsie! You know, back in my day if you were a journalist who wanted leaked war documents, you had to work the sources, meet them in a dark garage, earn the trust, pound the pavement. Now? You just wait for the national security advisor to be distracted by The White Lotus while he’s setting up his ‘bomb Yemen’ group chat."
Jon Stewart,"You can’t say words like ‘sex,’ or ‘women,’ or #MeToo? How can a lot of your cabinet members describe their weekends?"
Jon Stewart,"You can’t protest in a way that offends the right, you can’t teach things that the right doesn’t want you to teach, you can’t read things that they don’t want you to read, you can’t use words that they don’t want you to use, but they love free speech!"
Jon Stewart,He’s demanding they take it down because he believes this picture is unflattering. Which really makes you think—do you think other pictures of you are flattering? At least in the painting they blended the foundation into your hairline.
Jon Stewart,Social media is free speech in the same way that Doritos are food.
Jon Stewart,"Where are my conspiracy theorists at, now that it’s on the right? For God’s sake, billionaires are designing machines to manipulate our speech to control our behavior and rewire our brains. They’re removing our regular speech and doing a—I don’t know— great replacement of it."
Taylor Tomlinson,This is not helping Pete Hegseth’s reputation as guy who is always drunk.
Taylor Tomlinson,This is a drunk guy mistake. This is the national security equivalent of air-dropping a d*ck pic to everyone in the office.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Obviously, this is a huge f*ck up. But don’t worry, the White House has responded saying that from now on, discussions of military operations will be conducted over much more secure lines—Snapchat."
Stephen Colbert,‘Non-woke musicals.’ Also known as any musical you take your dad to.
Stephen Colbert,So… a dog?” on leaked audio of trump regaling the kennedy center board with the time he went to see cats with “somebody i should not have been there with
Stephen Colbert,"Does he think every song in Cats is called ‘Cats?’ ‘Of course, the showstopper was that famous song about memories—’Cats.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Wow. Man alive, you could have given me a thousand guesses and that would have been all of them."
Stephen Colbert,Really? Because it really seems like you want to do it. You’re like a guy who brought his guitar to the bonfire.
Stephen Colbert,"Let’s be fair. I can see why he’d be upset, because that looks exactly like him."
Stephen Colbert,"Trump, he’s still mad they don’t want to be the 51st state, so he dispatched Secretary of Homeland Security and Real Housewife of Guantanamo Bay, Kristi Noem."
Stephen Colbert,"That’s pretty ominous. When he decides he wants something, he will not let go. I remember what he said about that French fry that fell under the Resolute Desk."
Jimmy Fallon,"Seriously, how bad is the price of eggs when even the government needs a sponsor?"
Jimmy Fallon,"Hey, if people can’t find peace on 4/20 it’s never gonna happen."
Jimmy Fallon,"Although if there’s two things that don’t go together, it’s 4/20 and deadlines."
Jimmy Fallon,"Thanks to Amazon, the cake will be sent in 38 separate boxes."
