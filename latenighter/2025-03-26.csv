Ronny Chieng,"Oh, ha ha ha ha ha. You think that’s funny, don’t you? That the stupid Secretary of Defense is so stupid and/or drunk that he texted ‘we’re clean on OPSEC’ when there’s a reporter right in the group chat? Well laugh it up, people. Because unlike you, I have human empathy for these people who are just trying their best to kill other humans."
Ronny Chieng,"By the way, it wasn’t even Pete Hegseth who added him. It was some other incompetent guy at the highest levels of government, okay? [It was National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.] You think Hegseth has the editor of The Atlantic magazine saved in his phone? No way, okay. If Hegseth auto-filled a contact into a group chat, it would be like ‘Tampa Bay Blonde with Bugs Bunny Tattoo.'"
Ronny Chieng,"You have to ask, how did this happen? Don’t you guys have tech support in the government? [Photo of Elon Musk wearing his ‘tech support’ t-shirt at a cabinet meeting] Oh…"
Ronny Chieng,"Is anyone else kind of upset that we’re conducting war by emoji now? I mean, what does this even mean, ‘ I’m gonna fist the flag and then set it on fire? ‘"
Ronny Chieng,"‘Boris, I gave you the sound bite—stop asking followup questions. If I wanted to talk to a journalist, I would be on a private group chat with Pete Hegseth.'"
Ronny Chieng,"They weren’t even supposed to be talking about this stuff on Signal in the first place, okay? Signal might be a good app for you and me and our local drug dealer, but it’s not for the Pentagon to plan wars on."
Ronny Chieng,"That’s right, foreign adversaries could be watching whatever Pete Hegseth types into his phone. Like ‘bar near me,’ or ‘how to fool breathalyzer,’ or ‘how to uncrash car.'"
Ronny Chieng,‘Precision?’ Even your their texts weren’t hitting their intended targets.
Ronny Chieng,"This is like when your sex tape leaks and you’re like, ‘Hey, I’m glad you saw all of it. This proves my dick works.'"
Ronny Chieng,"By the way, the Trump Administration admitted that this thing happened, but it was a small mistake, and it was a good thing that it happened, but also what if the reporter made the whole thing up?"
Ronny Chieng,"So this reporter who is dishonest and sucks is also correct. And we added him to our group chat because he’s a fun hang? You can’t use, ‘it was a mistake’ and ‘it was fake news.’ You gotta pick one, okay? You gotta get together and figure it out—but not in a group chat! No more group chats."
Stephen Colbert,"That must have been really weird for Jeffrey. ‘Well, looks like the group chat’s blowing up—Yemen?!'"
Stephen Colbert,Turns out it was real and ‘Houthis’ refers to ‘Houthis idiots running our government?'
Stephen Colbert,"According to Goldberg, the texts sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them. Yeah, only the real Pete Hegseth would text, ‘u guys wamna get th pattry spartted? it’s five o’clork sometimes!'"
Stephen Colbert,This is a gargantuanly stupid screw-up. We have officially entered the Amelia Bedelia stage of government.
Stephen Colbert,"The J.D. Vance account texted ‘I think we are making a mistake.’ Coincidentally, also the original name of the group chat."
Stephen Colbert,"So to recap: the Secretary of Defense posted, on a publicly available app, specific war plans which were then seen by a reporter who was accidentally on the thread. It’s a phenomenon previously known as ‘brother of the bride on the bachelor party text chain.'"
Stephen Colbert,"What else are these ‘ merit-based hires ‘ posting? For all we know, for just $4.99 a month you might see the launch codes on OnlyFans."
Stephen Colbert,Trump might plead ignorance—and that’s believable.
Jimmy Kimmel,"They are also not supposed to have conversations like this on Signal because it can be hacked. And just to add another also to the mix, one of the people on the chain was in Russia at the time of the texts—not that they would ever try to look at those."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This is like—and I know Pete can relate to this—this is like getting drunk and driving your car into a lamppost, and blaming the lamppost."
Jimmy Kimmel,I bet Hillary is walking around the woods laughing her ass off today.
Jimmy Kimmel,What happened to this guy? He used to fire people on a daily basis—he fired Meat Loaf for less than this.
Jimmy Fallon,Today Trump said it will never happen again. From now on they will only chat about war plans over SnapChat.
Jimmy Fallon,Trump called the massive leak of classified information ‘a glitch.’ Which feels sort of like Boeing referring to a door flying off as ‘a little oopsie.'
Jimmy Fallon,"Democrats were like, ‘Glitch, please.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth denied responsibility for the security failure and insists that “nobody was texting war plans,’ even though the White House confirmed the breach. Yeah, pretty epic blunder. Today Trump gave it four out for five Giulianis."
Jimmy Fallon,Vladimir Putin had a portrait of Trump made and gave it to him as a gift. Although it’s concerning–when Trump hung it up his eyes started shifting.
Jimmy Fallon,"After receiving the portrait, Trump told Putin, ‘How did you know I would want that?’ Putin was like, ‘I also was on group chat.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that she’s going to eliminate FEMA. She was like, ‘FEMA is so bad. Literally everywhere they go, there’s a huge disaster.'"
Jimmy Fallon,Their job is to figure out which cars were vandalized and which cars just exploded themselves.
Taylor Tomlinson,Who would have thought that a company that asks you to spit into an envelope and send it to them doesn’t have a good business plan?
Taylor Tomlinson,"I’m just saying, all the other spit-based companies are doing well. PornHub—that’s the only one, but it’s doing great."
Taylor Tomlinson,"It’s crazy that a company can go bankrupt and sell your genetic data. Like, ‘You thought you were 20 percent Scottish? Well now you’re 100 percent Spirit Halloween."
Taylor Tomlinson,"It sounds bad, but this is the only way to get government-sponsored child care in red states."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Honestly, I didn’t even know there were children in Florida. I thought Floridians were just moving there for retirement or they just emerged from a toxic swamp, 46 years old with two DUIs."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Remember the good old days when people in France would be rude to Americans just for fun? Who knew we would long for the days when the worst thing people would say about us was that we were tacky and loud? Now if I go to Paris and somebody insults my outfit, I’m gonna be like, ‘Oh my God, thank you so much for not calling me a fascist.'"
