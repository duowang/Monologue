Seth Meyers,You’re the pres… why do we have to explain it to you! Don’t you have advisers who can fill you in? Don’t tell me you’re the one person they won’t invite to the group chat.
Seth Meyers,‘It just got sucked in’ is a terrible answer when your title is national security adviser. It’s not even a good answer if your title is Dave’s weird friend.
Seth Meyers,"Usually you only see that kind of reaction from a crowd when they reveal the results of a paternity test. They should start giving these town halls Jerry Springer episode titles like, ‘My Baby Daddy Cheated on Me Then Texted About War Plans!'"
Seth Meyers,"Oh I think I do maybe? Because you’re slashing nutritional aid, veterans benefits and Social Security and you expect us to feel bad about a stock price? I can’t believe this is what happened to the ‘f*ck your feelings’ crowd. They went from, ‘Cry more, libs,’ to, ‘Stop making me cry, libs.'"
Seth Meyers,"Tim Walz is a jerk? M’man, when you run around with a chainsaw on stage, you’re celebrating cutting jobs and benefits. To quote, I believe it was William Shakespeare, ‘The jerk store called and they’re running out of you.'"
Seth Meyers,"Trump loves to imagine himself as a towering historical figure who can intimidate his foes into submission, but in this portrait he looks like a thumb in a suit. He looks like he should be driving a pickle car in a Richard Scarry book."
Seth Meyers,This is also a very classic Trump self-own because if he hadn’t said anything almost no one would have seen this painting. I can’t remember the last Sunday I spent online scrolling through state house portraits of the current president. It’s been months!
Seth Meyers,"So all right… people want you to run for a third term which you can’t do, but it’d actually be a fourth term because Biden’s was your second term, but you don’t wanna take credit because he did a bad job during his term which was technically your term, but you had nothing to do with it, so you deserve a third term which is actually your fourth term. Is it possible that Air Force One is actually flying so high they’re losing oxygen?” on trump’s mid-air explanation"
Jon Stewart,"Yes! Veterans Affairs, Department of Education, USAID, f*ck you, f*ck you, f*ck you! Because all is right at the Department of Accidentally Texting War Stuff to Reporters."
Jon Stewart,"That is the coldest ‘My dear friend Mike’ I have ever heard in my life. ‘Anyway Brutus, you were saying about your dear friend Caesar?'"
Jon Stewart,"‘Why you askin’ me, I’m just an innocent passer-by. I didn’t see the accident but I gotta tell you, it looks like classic Mike to me.'"
Jon Stewart,"It’s not ‘somebody’s contact’—it was your contact. And he wasn’t ‘sucked in’ by unseen gravitational forces, you added him to the f*ckin’ chat."
Jon Stewart,"‘You get it, we didn’t endanger troops in a war plan, we endangered them in an attack plan. Who’s the assh*ole now?'"
Jon Stewart,"I’m sorry, ‘considering the option?’ What, are you trying to order off-menu from the Constitution? ‘Oh yeah, I see you got two terms here. Uh, but can I get it animal style?'"
Jon Stewart,"Although maybe Trump has something more creative in mind with the Vance thing. Have you guys heard of the movie Face/Off ? Yeah, so here’s how it’s gonna work. Trump will watch that movie as the military seizes power."
Stephen Colbert,"This isn’t a bull or a bear market, this is ‘Bees! Bees!!'"
Stephen Colbert,"Now ‘liberation day’ is like Independence Day, in that in that we’re the only country celebrating and somebody’s probably gonna get some fingers blown off."
Stephen Colbert,"That’s right, all countries! That means you, Federated States of Micronesia! Free ride’s over, buddy. Sure, this may raise the price some Americans pay for their Mariana fruit bats, but we’ll finally start manufacturing fruit bats in America again!"
Stephen Colbert,"Yeah, sounds like they’ve got a great new slogan. In three months they’ve gone from MAGA to TIT."
Stephen Colbert,"It’s not enough he’s destroyed so many of our cherished institutions, now he’s coming for Toyota-thon."
Stephen Colbert,"Which means the most popular car model will soon be public bus. You know their motto, Public Bus: How Come the Seat’s So Warm?"
Stephen Colbert,"If you don’t like Trump tariffs, and not many people do, don’t you worry. One day he won’t be president… maybe."
Stephen Colbert,"What kind of headline is that? Who cares what he ‘won’t rule out?’ I won’t rule out lying down on the Krispy Kreme conveyor belt and letting the glaze just take me, but that doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen. The Constitution forbids it."
Stephen Colbert,You kiss your couch with that mouth?
Stephen Colbert,That is terrifying. Trump is threatening to bomb Greenland into gravel. As opposed to what it is now: ice and gravel.
Stephen Colbert,That is just awful. The Smithsonian is renowned for giving us an unflinching examination of America’s complicated history. Plus astronaut ice cream.
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, somebody get out the spray paint. I want those pandas either all black or all white."
Jimmy Fallon,Sure that’s easy to say when you work from home.
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was like, ‘Some people might have to switch from riding in new limousines to riding in slightly older ones.'"
Jimmy Fallon,‘I edited the Constitution with a Sharpie and the Donstitution says it’s legal'
Jimmy Fallon,‘Remember how awesome it was to have a president in his 80’s?'
Jimmy Fallon,"‘It’s totally legal, according to new Supreme Court Justices Jake and Logan Paul.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, a sub filled with cocaine. Or as it’s known at Blimpies, a number 5."
Taylor Tomlinson,"It’s just like regular breast milk in that, if you’re eating it, you’re probably crying."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Get ready for Frida’s follow-up flavor, Postpartum Pistachio."
Taylor Tomlinson,"I mean, this is why Baskin Robbins stopped at 31 flavors."
Taylor Tomlinson,That’s how dystopian things have gotten. The biggest flex we can possibly think of is dental care.
Taylor Tomlinson,"First glasses became cool, now braces are cool. High school me really missed the f*ckin’ boat. I am gonna be so pissed if the next cool trend is accidentally calling the teacher mom."
