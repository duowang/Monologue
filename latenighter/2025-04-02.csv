Stephen Colbert,"Yes, ‘liberation day.’ I’m reminded of the immortal words of Patrick Henry, ‘Give me liberty or charge me an extra $10,000 on a Hyundai Elantra.'"
Stephen Colbert,"So, if you have a retirement account—no you don’t."
Stephen Colbert,"Way to connect with people suffering economic hardship, Republicans. ‘Uh, you know that thing where you not only own a home, but have the money to remodel it? Okay, you seem angry. Let me try another analogy. Let’s say one of your boats needs a paint job…"
Stephen Colbert,"‘Yeah, never heard kind. I’ve heard ‘selfish a-hole,’ I’ve heard ‘demented sack of garbage,’ I’ve heard ‘syphilitic sociopath who never got love from his father.’ And all of those were from Melania.'"
Stephen Colbert,He looks like an Uncle Sam who just found a stripper floating in his above-ground pool.
Stephen Colbert,He looks like if Henry Hill in The Music Man were a porno star and it ends with a stripper floating in an above-ground pool.
Stephen Colbert,All that is bad is now good. War is peace. Hate is love. Higher prices are lower prices. And that thing where you bite the inside of your cheek and you can’t stop biting that exact same spot all day long is now brunch.
Stephen Colbert,Trump has been flying them to El Salvador to a notorious maximum security prison where prisoners do not receive visits and are never allowed outdoors. And those are the kind of inhuman conditions previously only endured by people who work at Amazon.
Stephen Colbert,"An administrative error lands you in an inescapable prison where no one ever hears from you again. That’s like something out of that Kafka novel, Damn, That’s the Worst Thing I’ve Ever Heard, and Keep in Mind, I’m Dying of Tuberculosis in an Austrian Sanatorium! “ on the administration admitting that the man was sent there mistakenly—but they have no intention of calling for his release"
Stephen Colbert,"This is very bad, but at least they admitted their mistake. I mean who among us hasn’t accidentally popped a black bag over the head of a Maryland father and then rendered him to a hellscape prison in El Salvador?"
Michael Kosta,"The second Trump administration is off to a roaring start. If you don’t count the economy, inflation, rampant corruption, cyber-bullying of allied nations, and we’re all gonna die of measles."
Michael Kosta,"Yeah guys, relax. The president of the most powerful nation in the world is just—he’s in his Dennis the Menace phase."
Michael Kosta,"The truth is, Donald Trump doesn’t joke so much as he’ jokes.’ The same way guys joke with their wives about having a threesome. ‘Haha, you know that would be so wild. Obviously, we’d never do that. I mean, definitely not with my coworker Cindy that you said was pretty once. And I’m sure she’s open to stuff ‘cause her nose is pierced—that would be so hilarious, right? Or would it be sexy?'"
Michael Kosta,"Look, I’m not a legal expert. But I’d rather not be sentenced to life in a foreign prison with the same checklist system that Cosmo uses to decide whether I’m good-girl hot or bad-girl hot."
Michael Kosta,"It doesn’t even have to be a tattoo. You can get points for wearing a Bulls jersey. So good luck in prison, Hannah Montana—if that’s even your real name."
Michael Kosta,"Oopsie-doopise, I did a poopsie. Could it be that the geniuses who added Jeffrey Goldberg to the strike team group chat aren’t great at identifying the correct people?"
Michael Kosta,"Mister president, I don’t mean to alarm you, but the guy next to you–he’s scoring a lot of points on that checklist right now."
Seth Meyers,"Ah yes, the day we’ll all become liberated from our 401ks."
Seth Meyers,"At a rally in Wisconsin on Sunday for the Republican candidate in the state supreme court race, Elon Musk said it’s important to have children because the birth rate is declining and added ‘kids will make you very happy.’ At least the idea of them will. You know, just knowing you’ve got 14 or 15 of them out there, it wsill really warm your heart."
Seth Meyers,"A bible that was given to O.J. Simpson by Robert Kardashian Sr recently sold at action for more than $65,000, even though it’s apparently missing the fifth commandment."
Seth Meyers,"So if you love ice cream, and you love being on watchlists…"
Seth Meyers,"A woman recently returned a book to a New Jersey library that was 99 years overdue. Luckily it was New Jersey, so nobody was waiting for it."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, Trump’s calling tomorrow ‘liberation day’ while every stock broker’s calling it ‘inebriation day.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"He said, ‘Nobody pays higher prices on my watch. Unless it’s for a car, TV, medicine, or eggs, that’s it.'"
Jimmy Fallon,That’s too bad. One of my favorite Easter traditions is hiding Egg Beaters for the kids.
Jimmy Fallon,"If you’re wondering, that’s why the flags at the White House are flying at half mast."
Taylor Tomlinson,"I mean, take me out to the ball game but buy me dinner first."
Taylor Tomlinson,They’re trying to be moved up to the majora league.
Taylor Tomlinson,This is the first baseball logo with a pH balance.
Taylor Tomlinson,"I kept showing this to a guy friend and he didn’t see it. He kept pointing to the bottom of the oyster and being like, ‘Is the ball down there?'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Forget the A’s, this is a team logo that says, ‘Do the whole alphabet.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Once a month, they wear red jerseys."
Taylor Tomlinson,"This logo is the perfect reminder that, just like baseball, it’s okay to take a really long time to finish."
Taylor Tomlinson,"If the team wanted it to last longer, they should have just thought about baseball."
Taylor Tomlinson,"When the team’s chief marketing officer Ellen Walsh pulled the logo, she said, ‘None of saw what the internet saw.’ Which is a weird way of saying, ‘I don’t own a hand mirror.'"
