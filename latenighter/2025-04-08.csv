Seth Meyers,"‘What’s my handicap? I’d say a complete inability to empathize with my fellow human beings, that’s a big one.'"
Seth Meyers,Who the f*ck is Hank Tough? That sounds like the name—Hank Tough is Donald Trump’s porn star alter ego.
Seth Meyers,"Trump derangement syndrome, for those who don’t know, is when Trump does something deranged and you, I guess, notice it."
Seth Meyers,"The new line that losing money costs you nothing. The same people who spent four years screaming about the price of eggs are suddenly turning into Buddhist monks. The next time you turn on Fox News, Sean Hannity’s gonna be there with his head shaved saying, ‘Money is but a mirage, an empty vessel that cannot provide meaning. You came from the dust and to the dust you shall return.'"
Seth Meyers,"Yeah, it’s like if you’re rushed into the hospital and you flatline, it might not be a bad thing. It just means your heart is taking a nap."
Seth Meyers,"It’s like when you get back into a relationship with an ex you couldn’t keep up with because of their wild party lifestyle and you think maybe this time things’ll be different. And then a week later, you find yourself in a basement at 5 a.m. surrounded by strangers in Venetian masks on molly, and someone starts to unbutton your shirt and you finally get up the courage to say, ‘Hey, hands off!'"
Jon Stewart,Your economic policy has the same tagline as Season 3 of Squid Game ?
Jon Stewart,"You know what I always say, Live, Laugh Love! It’s 401K somewhere."
Jon Stewart,And when did the right become so chill? Aren’t you the ‘Bud Light’s turning my kid’s trans’ folks?
Jon Stewart,So everyone relax. This is merely a routine rat poison colonoscopy.
Jon Stewart,Their best argument so far for any of this is the same one we got about Tinkerbell being able to fly. You have to believe.
Jon Stewart,"Financial destruction not seen since the pandemic. And this time, there’s no controversy as to how it all started. There’s no wet market. You, Trump, released the contagion. It’s your lab leak, and it’s right out in the open. This is like if the researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology walked out to the Great Wall with a Tupperware and went, ‘We have an exciting announcement!'"
Stephen Colbert,"He’s only been talking about tariffs since the 1980s. In the campaign, he said that tariff is the most beautiful word in the English language. This is like electing Snoop Dogg and saying, ‘I didn’t know he was gonna smoke weed every day.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Wall Street clearly wants the president to change his mind, but he doesn’t have one."
Stephen Colbert,"That’s a weird thing to brag about. ‘Everybody’s makin’ fun of me for pooping my pants, but jokes on them—I pooped my pants on purpose. While everyone else is playing checkers… I’m poopin’ my pants.'"
Stephen Colbert,"China, if you want a trade war, then a trade war is what you’ll get! The gloves are off! Because you make the gloves and we can’t afford them any more."
Stephen Colbert,"That is an aggressively tone deaf press release.’ I’m sorry, Mrs. Jones. I botched the operation and your husband is dead. But this morning I got the Wordle in two.'"
Stephen Colbert,I know. His brain is broke.
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, he’s swinging for the fences. He missed and hit America in the S&P 500, which any economist will tell you stands for Scrotum & Penis 500."
Jimmy Kimmel,The world champion Los Angeles Dodgers met the draft dodger in chief today at the White House.
Jimmy Kimmel,It was a unique opportunity to have the franchise that signed Jackie Robinson to meet the president who had him removed from our government websites.
Jimmy Kimmel,"It was another tariffying day on Wall Street. The Dow was down, the S&P was down, cocaine was up."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Hey, I’m not an expert when it comes to the economy, but I am an expert when it comes to nicknames, and “panican"
Jimmy Kimmel,Remember when he told us to inject bleach to cure Covid? Turns out those were the good ideas.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump also skipped out on honoring four fallen soldiers so he could have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. In his defense, it was fajita night."
Jimmy Kimmel,Of course he won. Anyone who beats him gets sent to El Salvador.
Jimmy Fallon,"Today is National Beer Day. Yeah, it’s a very popular day. In fact, everyone with a 401k has been celebrating since last Wednesday."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump defended [the tariffs] by saying, ‘Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.’ RFK Jr heard and was like, ‘Then why’d you hire me?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"When you don’t have an Education Department, you have to start making up your own words."
Jimmy Fallon,"To be fair, if there’s anyone’s an expert on stuff crashing, it’s the CEO of Tesla."
Jimmy Fallon,"Today when Trump and Elon started fighting, Eric and Don Jr asked, ‘Are we gonna have two Christmases?'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Today the CEO of Spirit Airlines stepped down. He was like, ‘I’m gonna take off,’ and everyone was like, ‘We’ll see.’"
Taylor Tomlinson,"This is bleak. By Halloween, it’ll be too expensive to use pumpkins for jack o’lanterns. You’re just gonna have to face-paint your ugliest son."
Taylor Tomlinson,"I didn’t think therapists were allowed to talk about what happens during sessions. Now I’m scared my therapist is going to talk to a reporter like, ‘Yeah, many of my patients are saying that Trump’s presidency has been negatively affecting the vibe of the show they host on CBS.’ It’s like, ‘Rachel, shut up!'"
Taylor Tomlinson,Apparently it’s so realistic it even waits three messages to ask for feet pics.
Taylor Tomlinson,"I mean, men seem to understand video game rules. Maybe they would be better at flirting if they could see their dates had little health bars that go down every time they say something creepy. Like, ‘Oh, you just asked to see a picture of my sister? Well you didn’t just lose points with me, you just lost one life.'"
