Seth Meyers,"When your staff goes that over the top with praise, that’s when you know you f*cked up. I mean, they’re clearly overcompensating. They sound like Hollywood agents after a giant flop. ‘You crushed it. I mean, you killed it. Don’t listen to the critics, The Emoji Movie was art.'"
Seth Meyers,"It’s always funny when even Trump sounds like he wants to get the hell out of here. ‘I haven’t seen it, I’ve been stuck in this godforsaken meeting for two hours. Next time maybe you guys could kiss my ass over email?'"
Seth Meyers,"Because you tanked it! You set a house on fire and then you called the fire department, now you want credit for saving the house from the fire you started. ‘The house is still there, you’re welcome. Yes, a lot of it is very black and everything’s wet, but once again I have to stress, you are welcome.'"
Seth Meyers,The president should never describe people as getting ‘yippy.’ That’s how an old lady describes a dog that gets nervous around kids.
Desi Lydic,"Wow, give it up for friendly fire Barbie, everyone."
Desi Lydic,"To be fair, this is Kristi Noem… and those agents were wearing dog tags."
Desi Lydic,So congrats in advance to your dentist for his new Bentley.
Desi Lydic,"Ah yes, the war on showers, a fight Steve Bannon has been on the front line of his entire life."
Jimmy Kimmel,You selfish monsters. I hope you’re proud of yourselves. You couldn’t just let him drain your 401k?
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s quite a metaphor. ‘This is like post-Pearl Harbor.’ No, this is like if we had bombed Pearl Harbor ourselves."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Maybe he did it to distract us from all the other horrible stuff. Maybe he did it to distract from the fact that they’re deporting college students, and firing the people in charge of fighting disease and fires, and he’s attacking judges and journalists and lawyers, he’s taking lunch and life-saving medication away from children who need it, not to mention helping his buddy Putin crush Ukraine and menacing Canada and Greenland of all places. The fact is, we have a monkey flying the plane right now. And half the passengers are like, ‘I think the monkey’s doing a good job.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump is doing so much crazy stuff, Kanye tweeted pictures of Hitler this morning—no one even noticed."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yeah, it comes out drip, drip, drip. I believe that’s how Stormy described it, too."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You realize what’s going on here. Your grandpa, the weird one, got elected president. And now he’s gonna use the power of the power of the presidency to fix the things that bother him around the house. Like, he’s gonna sign an execuitve order to bring back the clicker because he can’t work the remote control."
Jimmy Kimmel,"If Joe Biden spent this much time talking about the shower heads, not only would they put him in a home, we would let them do it. We’d be like, ‘Yeah, he’s gotta go.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,Why would Trump even need a shower? You’d think the three-hour tongue bath he gets every morning from Fox & Friends would be sufficient.
Jimmy Fallon,"America was like, ‘What are you doing with our 401k?,"
Jimmy Fallon,Trump said he needs to stand under the shower for 15 minutes before he gets wet. I think the problem is Trump wears so much bronzer he’s made himself waterproof.
Jimmy Fallon,"KFC just introduced a fried chicken-flavored toothpaste and it sold out immediately. Yup, that was Trump’s executive order after shower heads."
