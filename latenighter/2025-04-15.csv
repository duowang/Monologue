Jon Stewart,He’s gonna do that to U.S. citizens. I think the hosts of The View are about to be ‘administratively errored.'
Jon Stewart,"Trump’s done a lot of the standard fare. He’s attacked the free press, pulled random people off the streets, made law firms and universities bend the knee, announced Department of Justice investigations against people whose sole crime was suggesting that the 2020 election had been safe and well-administered. You know, the bad, bad people."
Jon Stewart,"If he were Moses, I think that there were some ‘Thou shalt nots’ that he might want to take a look at."
Jon Stewart,"That’s not a dimension. Length, width, depth, four is time. There’s no f*ckin’ five. He is a god, who has created a whole other dimension. Through which he plays board games."
Jon Stewart,"I don’t know what your advisers have told you about the authoritarian bargain, but the basic deal is this. The American people look the other way while you disappear undesirables, knuckle under the elites, ban all seven trans athletes from our nation’s beloved NCAA fencing tournaments—you know, all the people that are holding us back. And then you in turn, make sh*t work. You wanna ignore the Supreme Court and all the other courts and take away people’s licenses to broadcast, fine. But when the planes go up, they’ve gotta come down. And not on fire."
Jon Stewart,"You can take over Greenland, demonize Canada, dominate the golfing pro circuit, but in return our children should be somewhat safe from most Victorian era diseases."
Jon Stewart,"You wanna destroy NPR, PBS, the Voice of America, sell the naming rights to the Washington Monument to HIMS.com, use the r-word, the p-word, the c-word, make up your own slurs, have the United States Naval Academy remove Maya Angelou from its bookshelves but for some reason keep Mein Kampf —which is a real f*cking thing that they did—we’ll be fine! We weren’t that crazy about this system of the government in the first place."
Stephen Colbert,"You’ve gotta hand it to J.D. Actually, don’t hand him anything."
Stephen Colbert,"I’m not saying America’s becoming misogynist, but this morning six women tried to flee the planet."
Stephen Colbert,"And this time, that rocket does not look like a penis. Because this time it is an all-female crew, it looks like a personal massager."
Stephen Colbert,"He continued, adding, ‘His well-being is also due to a cruel, indifferent universe where hardworking people are diagnosed with terminal illnesses, but an objectively evil monster who only eats cheeseburgers and fried chicken lives forever. The world is chaos, There is no God, proven by his frequent victories in golf events!'"
Stephen Colbert,‘Well-managed’ of course is a medical term meaning ‘covered in deck varnish.'
Stephen Colbert,"‘No, a very good soul. At least that’s what the red guy with the horns said down at the crossroads.'"
Stephen Colbert,I’d say that’s underselling it. At least in hell you never get a visit from Kristi Noem.
Stephen Colbert,Trump’s folks are trying to whoopsie-daisy a human rights violation. It’s like when Hitler came out with Mein Bad .
Stephen Colbert,Yes you do! You’re a dictator. All you have to do is dictate that he gets out of prison then go on Orbitz and get him a one way ticket to Maryland. And his torture will be over as long as you don’t fly him on Spirit Airlines.
Stephen Colbert,"Do you know how bad things have to be for an 83-year-old man to go willingly to Coachella? It’s loud, there’s nowhere to sit down, and it’s impossible to find orthotics that go with camo, micro-shorts, and a macrame halter top."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Katy Perry, Gayle King, and Jeff Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sanchez became the first group of women ever to visit outer space in a giant penis. I mean that is a penis, right? On Amazon they would call it a personal massager."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Bernie gave a rousing speech about America and what we need to do to save it, then did five songs with Tupac’s hologram, it was awesome."
Jimmy Kimmel,Maybe they just weighed Trump’s head.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The doctor said Trump’s BMO is 28. Right. And so is his next wife, by the way."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The same group of people that think Anthony Fauci is a liar and want him arrested hear that Donald Trump—a person they can see with their own eyes—weighs 224 pounds. They go, ‘Finally, an honest doctor.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Oof, to be fair he doesn’t like grabbing women by the hands."
