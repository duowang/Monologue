Ronny Chieng,"This is like every customer service call I’ve ever been on. ‘Oh, I’m sorry, this is billing. You’re looking for technical support, let me transfer you.’ ‘Hello, this is technical support. Oh, you need billing.’ Can somebody just help me cancel my f*cking cable? Except for Comedy Central, which is a vital service for society."
Ronny Chieng,"You asked a question, man. You can’t be mad that they’re trying to answer you. It’s like if a teacher said, ‘Okay class, who can tell me the capital of Norway? Anyone? Anyone? I said shut the f*ck up! Now answer the question! I said shut up!'"
Ronny Chieng,"Seriously, this guy has no criminal record at all. If he’s a terrorist, he might be the worst terrorist ever. I mean, he’s been in America for 14 years and he hasn’t done any terrorism. Maybe Trump is right and immigrants really are lazy."
Ronny Chieng,"What is happening here? I mean, this is America. We don’t just send someone to prison without evidence. We plant the evidence on them, it’s called due process."
Ronny Chieng,"Good for the Senator for what he’s doing, but it’s got to be at least a little disappointing for Garcia. He’s like, ‘Someone’s coming to break me out of prison? Is it Seal Team 6? Is it the guy from Prison Break with the tattoos? No, it’s me, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen!'"
Ronny Chieng,"This is a trap! It’s a trap, do not go. He’s gonna go there and the prison guards are gonna be like, ‘Oh, yeah yeah sure, Senator , he’s right inside that cell over there. Yeah, go on in—all the way in the back there…'"
Ronny Chieng,"Holy sh*t, we finally found a force more powerful than Trump’s hatred, Harvard’s love of sending rejection letters."
Ronny Chieng,"Look, I don’t usually root for Harvard because, well, they’re Harvard. They’ve got everything. It’s like rooting for Jeff Bezos to win the lottery."
Stephen Colbert,"Already? I don’t know what to wear! A jumpsuit? Oh, do I have a choice? Oh, it’s a jumpsuit."
Stephen Colbert,"Have some patience, we’ve all done it. You mean to send an email to just one guy in accounting and instead you kidnap a man and send him to a prison in El Salvador."
Stephen Colbert,"Keep in mind these are court orders, not court suggestions. The Supreme Court has to have more power than the bathroom sign that says employees must wash hands. ‘Cause you know Trump ignores that sign. He’s heading back to the table and dipping his pee-pee fingers right in the chicken bucket."
Stephen Colbert,"So the point is, Trump wants to arrest people without due process, in defiance of the Supreme Court. And also wants to include American citizens. We’re not on our way to a dictatorship, we’re on the ship with old tater-dick."
Stephen Colbert,"Regardless of your politics, those aren’t your politics. The only people who thrive in a dictatorship are the dictator and the fine folks at Carl’s Unmarked Windowless Van and Head-Sized Bag Depot."
Stephen Colbert,"Hey Trump administration: now you’re just like the rest of us, because you just got rejected by Harvard."
Stephen Colbert,"Dorm RAs were already drunk on power. This would only make them worse. ‘Uh, you guys, you’re not allowed to microwave popcorn in the common areas—I could send you all to El Salvador, okay?’"
Stephen Colbert,"But I’m guessing Harvard can weather this storm because they’ve been around for way longer than this country. In fact, Harvard was founded in 1636. Of course, back then the only majors they offered were Latin grammar, intro to leechcraft, and witch kindling."
Stephen Colbert,"If you’re watching this live at home, you have 20-ish minutes to get your taxes in before the deadline. And if you’re an IRS worker, you have recently been fired, I’m sorry about that."
Stephen Colbert,"On an inspiring note, today Major League Baseball celebrated Jackie Robinson Day. Yeah, we’re celebrating it and, thanks to the Trump administration, nobody knows why ."
Jimmy Kimmel,And who better to determine what colleges should and should not be doing than the man who had to shell out $25 million in penalties for running a fraudulent university he named after himself?
Jimmy Kimmel,My money’s on Harvard. I grew up in the 80’s. I saw Revenge of the Nerds . I know who wins these things.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The statue is seven feet tall, it’s made of bronze, and it’s already been issued a restraining order from the Statue of Liberty."
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s not his heart, honey, it’s his ass."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Biden spoke at a bi-partisan event to encourage Democrats and Republicans to work together to protect Social Security, which seems seems about as likely to happen as a reboot of Fiddler on the Roof starring Kanye West."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Social Security is number one for Joe Biden. Literally, his Social Security number is 1."
