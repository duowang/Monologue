Ronny Chieng,"RFK is known for his controversial health ideas, like drinking raw milk and adding roadkill to the food pyramid. But the conspiracy theory that he’s most known for is that vaccines cause autism. He’s basically a health expert the same way that Katy Perry is a rocket scientist."
Ronny Chieng,"Wait, that’s the big tragedy for you? ‘These poor kids will never know the joy of attaching a Schedule K to a 1040A.'"
Ronny Chieng,"That’s not even accurate. I mean, autistic people do pay taxes. Are you thinking of art history majors?"

Ronny Chieng,Everything this guy said is ridiculous. Autistic kids will never write poems? Well who wants kids to write more poems? That’s something we should be preventing.
Ronny Chieng,I mean why even pretend you’re going to study it? We all know you’re going to blame vaccines. This whole thing is more rigged than a golf championship at Mar-a-Lago.
Ronny Chieng,You know when commercials say 9 out of 10 doctors agree? This is the 10th doctor.
Ronny Chieng,"I mean, this guy looks like the reason second opinions were invented."
Ronny Chieng,"But enough about RFK, let’s move onto Elon Musk. Living proof that autistic people can do anything, including destroy the government."

Ronny Chieng,"I mean, you haven’t met this person, you’re already trying to raw-DOGE her?"
Ronny Chieng,"That’s where you draw the line? Like, ‘Yeah, I don’t want one of those woke social justice books, I’m looking for more of a beach read. Do you have Mein Kampf ?'"
Stephen Colbert,"See? We don’t need any more funding, we’ve already got a new anti-drug campaign for young people: Just say no—unless you want to see dinosaurs!"
Stephen Colbert,So look out for exciting new products like Tyson’s Tangy Buffalo Beaks N’ Thumbs.
Stephen Colbert,"HHS is also actively trying to make health officials dumber. They’ve halted efforts to collect data on everything from cancer rates in firefighters to outbreaks of drug-resistant gonorrhea. Which means soon the only source of data will be TLC’s new reality show, Drug-Resistant Gonorrhea Island ."
Stephen Colbert,"This Sunday, he is risen and you is high."
Stephen Colbert,"Sooo, it’s space farts. You know what they say, he who smelt it detected the possible signature of alien life on a distant planet."

Jimmy Kimmel,"They’ve done repeated analysis of the atmosphere and they suggest that an abundance of a molecule that on Earth has only one known source that is living organisms, also known as ‘sea scum’ is there. So we may have found a new home for Ted Cruz."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s only 120 light years away, so off you go, Elon and Jeff. Time to climb into those space dildos and boldly go away."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The way things are going, the U.S. has a better chance of being visited by aliens than Canadians."
