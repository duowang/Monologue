Seth Meyers,Donald Trump is the most unpopular president since Kevin Spacey.
Seth Meyers,"‘He has broken his own record for being the worst’ is a damning indictment of Donald Trump. But it also doesn’t reflect that well on the rest of us. ‘Who should we get for president?’ ‘Hey, remember that guy form four years ago who was a f*cking disaster, is he avail?'"
Seth Meyers,Bernie is the tough-love guidance counselor who believes in us. He should do his next speech sitting backwarrds on a chair in a high school classroom.
Seth Meyers,A lett—is this a constitutional crisis or a Jane Austin Novel?
Jon Stewart,"Unfortunately, I do think that it’s pretty clear that, on the economy, Donald Trump did make a boom-boom."
Jon Stewart,"Oh my f*cking god, that’s who we’re deporting? A kid with cancer? Trump really doesn’t understand how the Make A Wish Foundation works, does he?"
Jon Stewart,"This Pope had literally touched lepers. He drank sewage water in slums and survived all of it. 10 minutes! 10 minutes talking with J.D. Vance and the Pope is like, ‘God, check please.'"
Jon Stewart,‘I’m gonna end the war in Ukraine on day one. [Taps mic] Is this thing on?'
Jon Stewart,"Here’s the kicker. After saying to Russia, ‘Well, what if we divide it where you get everything,’ Putin just kept f*cking bombing. Trump is now reduced from the world’s greatest negotiator to, ‘Aw, c’mon…'"
Jon Stewart,100 percent bullsh*t! Here’s how you know
Stephen Colbert,"That is the worst polling number since polling began. I’ve gotta believe that’s hard to hear. ‘Babe, when I said that that was the worst sex ever, I only meant since sex began.'"
Stephen Colbert,"No one’s buying that. ‘I totally had a girlfriend at summer camp. She was a model, we did the whole sex deal. I felt the boobies—all 200 boobies.'"
Stephen Colbert,"For the record, 200 deals would mean that Trump had made trade deals with all 195 countries in the world, plus five bonus trade deals. ‘It’s true, folks, that’s the art of the deal. I made deals with Wakanda, Narnia, McDonald’s Playland, East Korea, and I just drove a very hard bargain with the princess of Genovia.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, he wants to be there personally at Tesla to offer all his most valuable employees his sperm."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Man oh man, if Obama had worn a blue suit to the Pope’s funeral, Sean Hannity’s head would explode inside Trump’s ass."
Jimmy Kimmel,"After almost 100 days in office, Trump is as popular as Kanye at a bat mizvah."
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s right, Canadians, vote for the man who puts the ‘whore’ in Tim Hortons."
Jimmy Kimmel,Canada is not going to be our 51st state. He just wants to distract us from the fact that J.D. Vance killed the Pope the other day.
Jimmy Fallon,Trump’s approval rating is down to 39 percent. Even measles is polling at 40 percent.
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, the calendar says 100 days in office, but the ‘feels like’ has to be in the hundreds of thousands."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump just announced that he’s bringing back Columbus Day, even though it’s still a federal holiday. Honestly, what better way to celebrate Columbus than announcing something that already exists?"
Taylor Tomlinson,"To be fair, you have to be on camera a lot when you are constantly f*cking up."
Taylor Tomlinson,"I think he’s getting ready for a big f*ck up. Like a big one. Like one day, he’ll drunkenly launch nuclear missiles and be like, ‘Pete Hegseth, who’s that? I’m Mrs. Hegsfire!'"
Taylor Tomlinson,it’s so crazy how surprised we are when a politician is actually held accountable. It’s kind of sad. I thought the only people who went to jail these days were innocent college students.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, nice try, George. You’ve been a lot of people, but you’re still not a white woman."
