Seth Meyers,"Of course Trump starts with kids who have 30 dolls, ignoring that some kids only have one or two. Saying, ‘instead of 30 dolls, give them two’ isn’t good advice for regular parents, it’s good advice for Veruca Salt’s parents."
Seth Meyers,"It’s 2025 and this guy’s plan for household savings is to cut from 250 pencils a kid? What’s next, ‘Not every quill needs to be a fancy peacock feather. A pigeon feather works just as well.'"
Seth Meyers,"Is there any place on earth that has 250 pencils? Oh right, a f*cking golf course."
Seth Meyers,"I already knew Trump never helped raise a child but now I’m starting to think he’s never met a child. When his kids were born, he shook their hands one time and said, ‘It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ll see you in 18 years.'"
Seth Meyers,"Sure, I guess gasoline would be more important than strollers if babies could drive cars. ‘It’s an easy solution, instead of strollers give the babies drivers licenses. How hard could it be to teach a baby how to drive a car. Rudy Giuliani can do it and he’s basically the same size as a baby.'"
Seth Meyers,"Now you want fewer options? Donald Trump is out there talking to us like we’re living in the communist Russia he always warned us Democrats were going to bring about.’Is new policy we’re going to bring about. I call it one doll, two pencils.'"
Jon Stewart,"I have to say, when Trump is talking about what people should do and gets with like, dolls and pencils? Trump has, like, such a Depression-era view of what kids play with in 2025. ‘Kids don’t need 20 sets of those hoops you hit with a stick as you go down the street. Just one hoop is Jim Dandy!'"
Jon Stewart,"To be fair to Donald Trump, his austerity pitch to the American people is in line with the modest way in which Trump conducts his life. Trump has a monastic view of simple living that says, ‘Hey, what if Saddam Hussein’s palace had a view of Central Park?'"
Jon Stewart,"If a Democrat had even hinted about toy rationing for American children, we’d have a full week of Fox News special reports on the sobbing children of socialist America, and there would be a boom of gun-toting patriots going, ‘You can have my G.I. Joe when you pry him from my kung fu grip!'"
Jon Stewart,"But this is the brilliance of Trump. In the same interview where he says to Americans, ‘Sorry about your Christmas, suck it up,’ he talks about a 90 million dollar parade that just so happens to fall on his birthday and is totally worth it."
Jon Stewart,"Because they run a museum. They’re not tough-talkin’ wardens, they’re docents with art history degrees. The only person working there is busy fixing those machine that flatten pennies."
Jon Stewart,"That wasn’t a gotcha question. Should the president uphold the Constitution? [Shrugs with baffled noise.] On Millionaire , that would be the warmup question, like, ‘What color is an orange?,’ or ‘Name a planet with people on it.'"
Jon Stewart,"Were you even awake? To protect, uphold, and defend—it’s not optional. It’s not an opportunity for you to workshop loopholes in our country’s foundational document. You took an oath. In front of God—and those who are fighting against God."
Jon Stewart,"The volatility of nonsense, from consequential to truly disorienting is unfathomable. While we’re tracing Pope and Alcatraz stories, the Trump administration has gutted funding for America’s food banks, they’ve hollowed out the FAA to the point the Newark Airport is basically inoperable—and not in its usual way."
Jon Stewart,"Motherf*cker. Do you know how bad you have to be to make the lives of sick 9/11 responders worse? The Trump administration is now number two on the 9/11 Evil Power Rankings. Bin Laden is still umber one, but you’re closing the gap."
Stephen Colbert,"Well it’s been great folks, but I think we can roll credits on the United States. Honey, I’m comin’ home."
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, that is the dumbest he’s sounded in a while. Quick follow-up, Mister President, do you still have the mental faculties to function as president?"
Stephen Colbert,I don’t know why she expects him to know the Fifth Amendment. He only invoked it 450 times on a single day .
Stephen Colbert,"Then have the trials! Otherwise we’re just living in the least popular Dick Wolf show, & Order ."
Stephen Colbert,"Wow, who could’ve seen that coming. All good stuff is Trump, all bad stuff is Biden. ‘Sunshine, that’s Trump. Rain? That’s sleepy Joe. Pizza, Trump. Box of spinach you buy because you’re trying to be healthy and you forget about it and it gets dark ad wet so you throw it out? That’s Biden. Ivanka—Trump, Eric—Biden.'"
Stephen Colbert,"I know that sounds crazy, but you’ve just gotta believe it was a compromise when his staff told him he couldn’t reopen Azkaban."
Stephen Colbert,"Now, as a Catholic, let me just say in the words of St. Peter, ‘Go f*ck yourself.'"
Stephen Colbert,"You were just at the Pope’s funeral! Remember everybody crying and the dead body on the floor? Did you forget that part? ‘Hey, I went to your grandmother’s funeral ad look at me! [Pulls out shirt to simulate boobies.] Look at me, I’m your grandma! Look, I’m wearing her clothes, I love butterscotch and Wheel of Fortune !'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"On Friday, MAGA Teresa posted this picture of himself as the new Pope, Pope Banana Cream Pious. Pope Eggs Benedict. Pope John Pull My Finger."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I have to say I knew this would happen. I predicted it, when he went to the funeral he saw all the gold at the Vatican he thought, ‘I could live here.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I’m sure he did do it to be funny and to make everybody who doesn’t like him mad, but what he seems to be forgetting is, he’s the President of the Untied States. Doing funny things to make people mad isn’t his job—it’s my job."
Jimmy Kimmel,Obese-Wan Kenobi. The MAGAlorian. Tannican Skywalker.
Jimmy Kimmel,In one weekend he upset the two most religious groups on the planet: Catholics and Star Wars fans.
Jimmy Kimmel,Which means he had brunch with Jon Voight at Mar-a-Lago this week.
Jimmy Kimmel,Next year The White Lotus is going to be set at a Hampton Inn.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He doesn’t know if he has to uphold the Constitution, he’d have to ask his lawyers. It’s the same answer he gives when he’s asked where Melania lives."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This isn’t one of Don Jr’s birthdays, you can’t just ignore it."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I see, it’s ‘Him do good, you do bad. Him parts not good, you parts good.’ Every interview now is like an episode of Kids Say the Darnedest Things ."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You’re right, think of them like wives. You can have two, three, four…"
Jimmy Fallon,"He was like, ‘Felling blasphemous, might delete later.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Gonna be fun seeing the next Lord of the Rings filmed in Bayonne, New Jersey."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was like, ‘All the Avengers movies until Endgame was me, Kraven the Hunter and Madame Web was Biden, Thunderbolts was me again."
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s pretty bad at Newark Airport. Right now the only air traffic controller’s a 16-year-old staffer they got from the top of a water slide. ‘You can go. You can go. Wait, hold on—yeah, you can go now.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"The Kentucky Derby was this past weekend. And the winner was a horse named Sovereignty who beat a horse named Journalism, I presume because he got stuck behind a paywall."
Taylor Tomlinson,"A horse named Sovereignty beating one called Journalism is a little too on the nose for what’s happening right now. Get ready for next year, when Checks and Balances loses to Measles."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, how disrespectful to this event that’s based on gambling and animal abuse."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Donald Trump just threatened a 100 percent tariff on all foreign films. Yeah, if he goes through with this, some film nerd is definitely gonna get caught at the border trying to smuggle Amelie on a flash drive up their ass."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Think of all the foreign films we’ll miss out on. Remember Parasite ? If he goes through with this, the only parasite we’ll have left is the one living in RFK Jr’s brain."
Taylor Tomlinson,"And we all know Trump won’t stop there. First it’ll be a tariff on foreign films, then it’ll be a tariff on films written by women, soon there’ll be a tariff on any film not about a dog playing basketball."
Taylor Tomlinson,"We should have seen this coming, though. The horse that came in last place at the Kentucky Derby was called International Cinema."
