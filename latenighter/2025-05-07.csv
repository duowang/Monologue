Desi Lydic,Trump has been obsessed with making Canada the 51st state ever since he discovered that Epstein Island was not eligible.
Desi Lydic,"Aww, it’s like watching an episode of Love on the Spectrum . If the spectrum was fascism."
Desi Lydic,"I think Donald Trump just got friend-zoned. Canada’s like, ‘You have been such an amazing ally but I think we really work better as sovereign neighbors. Besides, I already have a girlfriend. You haven’t met her because she lives up in Canada—aw, that excuse doesn’t work.'"
Desi Lydic,"Canada is not going to f*ck you. God, this is why you don’t date someone who lives on the same continent as you—awkward."
Desi Lydic,The Real ID is not that different from a regular ID. It just has some enhanced security features that verify your identity as a little goody two-shoes that does whatever the government says—nerds!
Desi Lydic,"Wait until everybody starts showing up at the airport with no idea that they don’t have the right ID. People are going to flip the f*ck out. There are going to be Karens flipping out on their phones with other Karens in the background filming rants on their phones, just an infinite tunnel of Karens."
Desi Lydic,"‘I don’t know where you are?’ That’s a terrifying thing to hear. There’s not a lot of backup systems. The pilot can’t be like, ‘Okay, forget radar, let’s try something else—Marco!'"
Desi Lydic,"You know what, he is so relatable. We get stuck at the airport, he gets stuck at the airport. We don’t know how to run the Department of Transportation, he doesn’t know how to run the Department of Transportation."
Stephen Colbert,"The man in charge of fixing this mess is, unfortunately, Transportation Secretary and White Lotus guest remembering what he did at the full moon party, Sean Duffy."
Stephen Colbert,"Those are the people who do the stuff! There are plenty of useless people you could have fired, like the TSA agent who says you can’t bring in a snow globe."
Stephen Colbert,"Counterpoint: if you could afford all costs, you wouldn’t be in Newark."
Stephen Colbert,"Wait a second, there’s such a thing as trauma leave? Byeeeee!"
Stephen Colbert,"He thinks movies are real life! ‘I saw a terrifying documentary, folks, last night about this guy Shrek and his talking donkey. By the way, folks, don’t let the wife fool you. She looks beautiful, but she is also… a Shrek."
Stephen Colbert,"There’s sad news in the wide world of web, because the pioneering teleconferencing app Skype is officially dead. And if you can’t attend the memorial service in person, there will be a Zoom link."
Jimmy Kimmel,Poor Mark Carney had a hell of a job today. It was like an Ewok going to a meeting on the Death Star.
Jimmy Kimmel,"That’s true, he doesn’t take no for an answer. In fact, he was found liable for it in a court of law ."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He said Citizen Kane , Gone With the Wind , Goodfellas , The Godfather , and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly , which is a film he loves so much. It inspired his nicknames for Ivanka, Eric, and Don Jr."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It took a while, we finally found a draft Trump won’t dodge."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Not helping was Skype’s slogan, which was ‘Zoom for people who haven’t tried Zoom—please don’t try Zoom.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Never forget, Skype was the original way for your coworkers to catch you masturbating during a meeting."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Well as we all know, last night was the Oscars for clothes, also known at the Met Gala."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Now, if you’re anything like me, you wait for this one special night to go, ‘Oh, again? And what is it?'"
Taylor Tomlinson,Some noticed that Gala chair and Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour had a small stain on her dress. So now we know next year’s theme is going to be The Skin of Your Former Assistant.
Taylor Tomlinson,"This is so f*cked up. This is more predatory than when you delete photos of you and your ex online and guys immediately DM you like, ‘Hey, I just wanna say hi.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"And this info is when she worked at Facebook nearly 10 years ago. Now it’s even worse. Now when you Google, ‘Where is my polling location?,’ and it gives you pictures of Donald Trump scoring the winning goal at the World Cup."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Which is not even smart, okay? If I’m using words like that, I’m not talking about me, I’m probably talking about Mark Zuckerberg."
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night was the Met Gala and it rained all night. Thankfully, everybody was able to stay dry under Diana Ross’ dress."
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, thousands of celebrities from all over the world came together with one common goal, figuring out how to sit."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump said if Canada became the 51st state, it would be a wonderful marriage. And people were like, ‘How would he know?'"
Jimmy Fallon,Trump’s tariffs against China are raising the cost of wedding dresses. It’s not good. Now brides are saying yes to the jeggings at Kohl’s.
Jimmy Fallon,It’s getting to the point where we really should clap when the plane lands.
Jimmy Fallon,Burger King is facing a lawsuit saying that their Whopper hamburgers are smaller than advertised. Meanwhile Burger King’s legal defense is that the king has divine power and doesn’t recognize any courts.
Seth Meyers,"I love that you can tell from his social media posts what movie he watched on the plane. Honestly, I’m dying to know what he thought of Conclave ."
Seth Meyers,"Trump joked yesterday with reporters about becoming the Pope and said, ‘I would not be able to be married though.’ [Photo of white smoke emanating from the Vatican] And it looks like Melania’s voted."
Seth Meyers,"And to honor Trump’s military service, he won’t be there."
Seth Meyers,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that A.I. can be useful for talking through difficult conversations that users need to have with people in their lives. Oh buddy, if that were true, your family would have done it a long time ago."
Seth Meyers,"Developers at the video game Grand Theft Auto have delayed the release of its sixth installment. Apparently, during the beta testing they couldn’t get anybody to steal the Cybertrucks."
