Seth Meyers,"You know Trump’s going to try to claim credit for this. ‘The tariffs are working. We’re making our own Popes now, right here in America. We’re gonna reopen the Pope factories.'"
Seth Meyers,"Man, J.D. Vance is 0 for 2 on Popes. He grim reaper-ed the last one, and got dunked on by this one. That’s how you know the new Pope’s from Chicago."
Seth Meyers,"I mean, the Pope’s supposed to love everyone, but this guy’s like, [Chicago accent] ‘Hey, J.D. can kiss my ass.'"
Seth Meyers,"No, no it can’t. It has to be one answer. We’re talking about global trade policy, not the Mona Lisa. ‘Is she smiling or is she sad? It can be both!'"
Seth Meyers,Why does everything with these guys sound like a local car commercial. ‘Come on down to Honda’s 90 deals in 90 days sale! You won’t believe how low these prices are on a new Honda Civic.'
Seth Meyers,"For one thing, there aren’t even 200 countries on Earth. Is he making deals with other planets? ‘Yeah, we’ve got a trade deal now with Jupiter. They’re gonna give us one of their—we have two moons now!'"
Seth Meyers,"For real, what’s going on here? Is it letter of intent, memorandums of understanding, deals, sketches of deals, blueprints of deals, concepts of deal or sub-deals? There are more euphemisms in this administration than a religious household talking about where babies come from."
Desi Lydic,‘Breathe it in?’ I didn’t know we were supposed to hot box the Pope-smoke.” on one reporter’s hyperbolic announcement
Desi Lydic,"Holy sh*t! The first American Pope. And let me just say, as an American, are you sure about this?"
Desi Lydic,We don’t really have the sort of gravitas you associate with pope-iness. We’re less somber procession and more monster truck rally.
Desi Lydic,I guess it’s a little bit weird that the holiest man in the world knows all the words to the Chili’s baby-back ribs song.
Desi Lydic,"But the votes are counted and the Vatican doesn’t have a January 6, so there’s no going back."
Desi Lydic,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa—so you ‘re telling me that you think all Americans are loudmouth jackasses? Well, f*ck you!"
Desi Lydic,"Now, I’ve always found this odd. The church is so conservative on gay issues, but then they turn around and make its leader pick a drag name.’And make it quick! We’ve gotta get you to your gown fitting, you’re gonna look so fierce.'"
Desi Lydic,"Yes, yes, how dare you! If English was good enough for Jesus, it’s good enough for the Pope."
Desi Lydic,The new Pope does not like J.D. Vance. He really is an everyday American.
Stephen Colbert,Nice … that he’s so young.
Stephen Colbert,"Hey, I’m an American! I shouldn’t have to press 2 for Pope."
Stephen Colbert,"Holy Father, you had me at ‘J.D. Vance is wrong.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, she’s a very private person… who has film crews following her around for the $40 million documentary about her life."
Stephen Colbert,"The cuts resulting in a loss of $23 million from the program called Ready to Learn, which will now become the Trump program, Durrrrrr."
Stephen Colbert,"Look there’s no shame in it, Burger King. A lot of guys lie about the size of their Whopper."
Jimmy Kimmel,The Popemobile is now a Ford F-250 with Truck Nutz.
Jimmy Kimmel,This must have been what it felt like when they opened the first Olive Garden.
Jimmy Kimmel,"No, Trump was not elected by the conclave. Another election was rigged against him."
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump just hit the Vatican with an 80 percent tariff on pointy hats.
Jimmy Kimmel,This is an historic moment that we’re living in. We have an American Pope and a Russian president.
Jimmy Kimmel,He is very proud of making a trade deal with a country we were trading just fine with until he screwed it all up.
Jimmy Kimmel,"So rest easy, Ma and Pa MAGA hat, you’re still gonna lose the farm but you’ll only have to pay 10 percent extra on that Rolls Royce you’ve had your eye on."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Still no deal with China, but you got England. When your daughter asks for a Barbie for Christmas this year, just say, ‘We can’t afford that, honey, but maybe you’d like some John Smedley knitwear?'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I see, it because he’s gay. And not just regular gay—bicycle gay."
Jimmy Kimmel,Pete Hegseth’s phone shouldn’t even have passwords. It should have one of those tubes you blow into when you get a DUI.
Jimmy Fallon,"You can tell he’s American because he stepped out on the Vatican balcony and said, ‘New Pope, who dis?'"
Jimmy Fallon,People are excited about the new Pope being from Chicago because that means we’re one step closer to deep dish communion wafers.
Jimmy Fallon,The new Pope actually graduated from Villanova University. It’s wild that we have a Pope that might have done a keg stand outside of an Eagles game.
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump made an interesting deal. We’ll send them American food like beef and pork, and in return they will not send us any British food."
