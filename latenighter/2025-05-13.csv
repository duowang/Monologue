Seth Meyers,"First of all, being ‘an entertainment person’ doesn’t seem to be bothering you very much. Pirro is the 23rd current or former Fox News employee hired by the Trump White House. If you work at Fox News right now and you haven’t been offered a job at this administration, you must be wondering, ‘Does he, like, hate me?'"
Seth Meyers,"In the annals of presidential history, we had FDR’s fireside chats, JFK’s inaugural address, and now Donald Trump saying, ‘My overweight friend takes the fat shot drug.'"
Seth Meyers,"If you put those words in anyone else’s voice, we would immediately recognize them as senile."
Seth Meyers,"This is what Trump does. He creates a problem, then he solves the problem by just undoing the thing he did, then he claims credit for the end result, which is nothing. But on Fox News they call him a genius and if they’re lucky, he makes them, I don’t know, Secretary of Agriculture?"
Seth Meyers,"That’s insane. That’s like if after France gave us the Statue of Liberty, in 1885, Grover Cleveland got to take it home and keep it in his backyard."
Seth Meyers,"One, no one thinks you would ever say no to a free plane. Two, they’re not giving it to us, they’re giving it to you! It would be different if Qatar said, ‘Here’s a free two-story luxury jet and every American will be entitled to one free ride to a destination of their choosing.'"
Jon Stewart,The United States government is actively looking at suspending due process and the rule of law. That’s a big announcement. Big enough for Stephen Miller to risk bursting into flames because of the touch of God’s sunlight.
Jon Stewart,"Just eyebrows? ‘The Trump administration is thinking of tearing up the Constitution so here in Washington, we’re hearing a lot of, ‘Huh.’ One legal scholar even said, ‘That’s weird.'"
Jon Stewart,What?! Qatar is giving us a plane that Trump gets to keep. He’s like the reverse Oprah. ‘I get a jet! And that’s it.'
Jon Stewart,Oh. Trump’s gonna take a $400 million jet from people he would expel from Columbia University.
Jon Stewart,"It’s not a free jet. That’s the point. You know the expression, ‘There’s no such thing as a free lunch?’ That’s about being skeptical of the motives of somebody who gives you a sandwich. A BLT. Now imagine that that BLT has an engine, nine bathrooms, and funds proxy wars."
Jon Stewart,"That took a turn. ‘Top guy, brilliant, you know him. Famous, bit of a chubs.’ Anyway, I’m sure a public press conference is a rough way for this guy to find out that he is saved in Trump’s phone as Neurotic Fat Friend."
Jon Stewart,"Do you read any of your briefings? ‘He takes the fat shot. You know, the fat shot. I got another friend, brilliant, real estate mogul—he takes the dick-stiff pills.'"
Jon Stewart,"Meanwhile, it feels like a decade ago that they threatened to suspend habeas corpus—it was Friday."
Jon Stewart,White South Africans? [Picture of Elon Musk] That’s the only group we’re opening—you already have one!
Stephen Colbert,"That’s Qatari Air Force One. You know their slogan: ‘Yes, yes, speak louder into the tray table.'"
Stephen Colbert,"And with a gift, of course it’s not the money, it’s the thought that counts. That thought, ‘Let’s bribe the president.'"
Stephen Colbert,I actually think it’s fitting that the only thing Trump’s going to check out of his library is ‘big plane.'
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, it’s true. Anybody can not take a free plane. I’m doing it right now."
Stephen Colbert,"But you know what? Donald Trump knows that this is America! We do not negotiate with terrorists—we accept what they’re offering, no questions asked!"
Stephen Colbert,"Nothing more presidential than fat-shaming. It reminds me of that inspiring quote from George Washington: ‘I cannot tell a lie, your ass is enormous.'"
Stephen Colbert,"You did not come up with the word equalizing! If you did, then what has Queen Latifah been doing for five action-packed seasons right here on CBS?"
Stephen Colbert,This is a major victory for Donald Trump. To somehow negotiate his way out of the economy-crippling tariffs put in place—by Donald Trump.
Stephen Colbert,"What happened to all the wonderful things Trump said tariffs would pay for? He said if we had tariffs, Americans wouldn’t pay any more income tax, tariffs would curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, they would create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices, subsidize child care, and promote world peace."
Stephen Colbert,And I’m sure she’s excited. I hear on Friday night that she drank a whole bottle of champagne. And then someone told her the news.
Stephen Colbert,"You may know Pirro from her years hosting Judge Jeanine on Fox, where she promoted voter fraud claims, compared January 6 rioters to Revolutionary War soldiers, and got pulled briefly from the network after making Islamaphobic comments. She was later reinstated after Fox realized they didn’t care."
Stephen Colbert,It’s not great when Washington’s top attorney can be best described as Lady Giuliani.
Stephen Colbert,That class? Court-mandated traffic school.
Jimmy Fallon,"Everybody’s rightfully focused on the plane, but to me the big headline is that he’ll eventually leave office."
Jimmy Fallon,"The 89 passenger luxury plane has wood finishes, custom carpets, and gold walls. The only thing it doesn’t have is a way to safely land at Newark Airport."
Jimmy Fallon,It’s never good when you get ghosted by your air traffic controller.
Jimmy Fallon,"The list of the most popular baby names in the United States was just released. This year the most common first name is Liam. And for the eight year in a row, the most common last name is Musk."
Taylor Tomlinson,She made it very hard for blonde businesswomen everywhere. She’s the reason I can’t wear turtlenecks.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Sort of like when Al Capone was arrested and his wife started a totally separate waste management company. Or when Jeffrey Epstein’s girlfriend was like, I just bought my own island, okay?'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Apparently this startup has already gained millions of dollars in investments. You know the old saying, ‘Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, here’s my blood.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"His startup is called Haemanthus, which is Greek for, ‘Hey man, this isn’t sus.'"
Taylor Tomlinson,"Listen Billy, as a start, if you want people to think your company is super-different, maybe don’t name it like a mythical demon. Theranos and Haemanthus sound like together they were responsible for the fall of Rome."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Did Elizabeth Holmes just get on Tinder and make her bio like, ‘Hit me up if you like biking and doing blood scams.'"
