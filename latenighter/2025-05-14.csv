Jordan Klepper,"You gotta hand it to the Saudis, though. They know that the fastest way to Trump’s heart is through his stomach, out the colon, with a little bit staying behind in his arteries."
Jordan Klepper,"Well, well, well. Look who’s sleepy now."
Jordan Klepper,"Mister president! I mean, you can’t fall asleep there. This isn’t an intelligence briefing, c’mon, man!"
Jordan Klepper,"I agree, you might like him too much."
Jordan Klepper,"But you may be wondering, why did Trump pick these three countries for his first foreign trip? Well, there’s a strong geopolitical balance of—I’m f*cking with you! Corruption! “ on trump’s choice of saudi arabia, qatar, and the united arab emirates for his first overseas trip"
Jordan Klepper,"The Trump boys have projects in all three countries. I never thought I’d say this, but can’t these countries go back to doing something more productive, like funding terrorism?"
Jordan Klepper,"Yeah, I think we can stop pretending that this airplane is going to be ‘transferred to his presidential library.’ This is like the news reporting your aunt is bringing ‘her good friend Linda’ to Thanksgiving."
Jordan Klepper,There you have it! Trump hasn’t given them anything and it’s been like 36 hours.
Jordan Klepper,"You know, it looks bad. But you have to understand, that’s a lot of money. And money feels good to have and to spend, so now I get it."

U.S. intelligence has determined that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder and dismemberment of American journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, so here is how Trump talked about him. [Clip of Trump saying of bin Salman, ‘I like him too much’] ‘I like you too much—you’re like the son I never had. What’s that? How many?'"
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, that’s an unusual Mother’s Day brunch. ‘And what can I get you folks started on?’ ‘Uh, nothing for me. I’m saving room to eat a bunch of poop in a creek later, thank you very much.'"
Stephen Colbert,"The more we learn about this fella, the more I like him. He’s like a regular Joe Six-Pope."
Stephen Colbert,"It seems crazy to have a Pope who’s a hoops fan. But it’s right there in the Bible: ‘And Jesus said unto them, ‘Come on, that’s a foul! Are you blind, ref? Because if so, my child, I will heal you.'"
Stephen Colbert,"It sounds delicious, and it’s perfect for devout Catholics, ’cause you eat at Portillo’s enough, you’re gonna meet Jesus real soon."
Seth Meyers,"During a press conference yesterday, President Trump said that if China had signed a trade deal during his first term, the Chinese ‘would be able to buy products that they’ve never been able to buy.’ I’m sorry, you think they want stuff from us? They have iPhones, we have cars that can’t get wet ."
Seth Meyers,"You know, I used to think that is was crazy that he had a brain worm. But now I think it’s crazy that he only had one."
Seth Meyers,"In a statement released yesterday, the FAA said that as few as three air traffic controllers were scheduled to work last night at Newark Liberty Airport. On the plus side, nobody is working at Hudson News. Take all the trail mix and magazines you want, it’s a free for all!"
Seth Meyers,Well that’s gonna come as quite a surprise to Queen Latifah.
Seth Meyers,"Authorities in Pennsylvania arrested a woman after she allegedly stole more than $1,000 worth of candles from a CVS. On the bright side, her arrest was very romantic."

Taylor Tomlinson,"The goal is to improve their poor attention spans, but not listening to music cannot be the solution. I mean—if you’re trying to quit smoking weed you don’t also need to quit Doritos."
Taylor Tomlinson,And I thought Millennials getting into vinyls was annoying.
Taylor Tomlinson,"And at least music isn’t physically dangerous. I can do it while I drive, and if I sneak a little music to my teen nephew, I don’t get banned from Thanksgiving."
Taylor Tomlinson,"This new generation is either going to become the most zen, enlightened group of people ever, or, like, the parents from Footloose ."
Taylor Tomlinson,"The issue is overstimulation, not music. They’re listening to music while looking at their phone while eating hot Cheetos while snorting Adderall."
