Seth Meyers,How dare you! Donald Trump didn’t pick Saudi Arabia as his first official trip because his family has billions of dollars in business there. He picked it because he’s making the Hajj to Mecca. He is exploring different religions for a documentary series on NatGeo called Are You There God? It’s Me Donald .
Seth Meyers,So even Republicans are a little queasy about Trump’s Middle East corruption tour. I guess they’re not thrilled about the fact that the three countries Trump visited this week just happen to be places where he’s making—and I believe this is the technical term—fat stacks.
Seth Meyers,"I’m sorry, but you can just tell by the name that World Liberty Financial is an obvious scam. That sounds like a company that sells asteroid insurance to senior citizens."
Seth Meyers,"That’s what you took away from your intelligence briefings? It must be so frustrating to get back from a meeting with Trump and your friends ask you , ‘How far did you get on the Qatar report?’ ‘How to pronounce it!’ ‘Did he at least settle on one?’ ‘Nope!'"
Seth Meyers,"He looks like a turtle who heard a twig snap. Knows it’s bad, still not gonna move."
Seth Meyers,"May I ask what is the purpose of this trip? Is it just for you to ramble about things that are in your field of vision? ‘Beautiful marble, flag, flag—plant.'"
Seth Meyers,"Whoa dude, play it cool. It makes sense you’re in the desert, ’cause you thirsty as f*ck."
Seth Meyers,"Oh my God, if this was a wedding, someone would cut the mic. ‘You’re so hot, you’re so hot. Can’t believe you’re taking yourself off the market. Look at how f*cking hot he—[taps mike, wondering why no one can hear him].'"
Stephen Colbert,Did the commander-in-chief just call the B-2 bomber fugly?
Stephen Colbert,"‘Look, look, I tell you, if our pilots have to fly an uggo plane, frankly I’d rather lose the whole war.'"
Stephen Colbert,He wants overwhelming force because this is bigger than D-Day. It’s his B-Day.
Stephen Colbert,"It’s my birthday slumber party! Okay fellas, let’s play never have I ever. I’ll start. Never have I ever… served in the military!'"
Stephen Colbert,"Yes, she couldn’t find anybody before ingesting psilocybin, but now she’s very happily engaged to a wolf head made of prismatic crystals."
Stephen Colbert,Many people are skeptical that tripping balls is the right way to find a life partner. Although ingesting psychotropic fungus could be a great way to meet a fun guy.
Stephen Colbert,She even hooked up with a couple of them and now she’s got Dutch elm disease.
Stephen Colbert,"‘Probably?’ Measles is the most contagious virus known to man. In this century alone, vaccines have prevented 60 million deaths. But sure, probably. And while we’re at it, let’s just change the warning labels on bleach to ‘Poison: Only give your kids a little.'"
Stephen Colbert,"I don’t think so either! We’re in complete agreement. So maybe stop giving it out and let us get our medical advice from trained professionals. Someone qualified. Like, I don’t know, a lonely and unlicensed Surgeon General wandering the forest looking to hook up with a sycamore."
Jordan Klepper,So Pete Buttigieg should have taken a plane to work?
Jordan Klepper,"No, no, no, no, no—it wasn’t about lumberjacks! Not about lumberjacks! You were talking about drones. Forget about the lumberjacks!"
Jordan Klepper,He’s a great Sean? We’re just ranking Seans now?
Jordan Klepper,"At this point they were like, ‘Can we just give you our bribe and go home?'"
Jordan Klepper,"Look at those faces. This man is a Boeing executive. His planes fall out of the sky and he’s sitting here like, ‘This is a f*cking disaster.'"
Jordan Klepper,"Can you imagine the translator at this event listening to all of this sh*t like, ‘Uh, uh—he says he loves it here?'"
Jordan Klepper,"[Pulling out chart] “Okay, so just to recap here. So, we went from drones, to lumberjacks, to Sean Duffy, to Pete Buttigieg, back to Sean Duffy as a sexy lumberjack. And I won’t play the rest for you because he went on for 13 more minutes, with mentions of, and this is all true: the stock market—he got into there for a little bit; Lee Greenwood, obviously; and how the 2020 election was rigged. And in case you’re wondering when he weaved his way back to the drones—he never f*cking did."
Jimmy Fallon,It’s ironic because that’s actually some great medical advice.
Jimmy Fallon,"My guess is if you collect Pope trading cards, you’re probably more celibate than the Pope."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, it was strange.All the employees walked out and the line moved just as fast."
Jimmy Fallon,"Meanwhile over at Dunkin’, you’re allowed to wear an apron with nothing underneath it."
Jimmy Fallon,"Newark Airport was like, ‘Six minutes? Please, call us when you hit six days.'"
