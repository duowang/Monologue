Stephen Colbert,Hope you had a good weekend. The president spent it settling back into the White House after his Middle East all-you-can-bribe buffet.
Stephen Colbert,"He was having such a good time with the princes and the palaces and the marble and the gold, and the special souvenir he wants to bring home, obedience to leaders on punishment of death."
Stephen Colbert,"First of all sir, keep my best friend’s name out of your filthy nugget-hole."
Stephen Colbert,"Have you noticed how she hasn’t gone to Kansas City Chiefs games since February? Am I the only one? Also, Taylor hasn’t gotten a single Christmas present all spring."
Stephen Colbert,"What are you doing? Attacking Bruce is like attacking America itself. I haven’t seen a politician be this tone deaf since Herbert Hoover’s campaign slogan, Apple Pie Sucks and So Does Your Mom."
Stephen Colbert,Pretty bold to say someone else’s skin has atrophied when your own complexion could best be described as ‘tandoori catcher’s mitt.'
Stephen Colbert,"That is chilling. And you know right now in Hollywood, some agent is getting this phone call: ‘Why am I not on Trump’s list? Why does Oprah get sent set to all the good gulags? Listen, I went to Juilliard, why can’t I get arrested in this town?'"
Stephen Colbert,"I know that sounds dystopian. But to be fair, that’s how citizenship has always worked. In fact my great-grandfather actually won the first season of So You Think You Can Dig the Erie Canal ."
Stephen Colbert,"Yeah, and anyone who thought about this for six seconds would know this is The Hunger Games ."
Stephen Colbert,"Because, as Catholics know any spirit other than missionary is a sin."
Jon Stewart,Don’t news people have to tell you what they know when they find it out?
Jon Stewart,"To be fair, when you forget a white guy’s name, Steve is a good guess."
Jon Stewart,"‘It’s so hard. Such a difficult time. Unfathomable in terms of the pain his family must be feeling. And yet, if you act now. And if you use the code /tapthatbook…"
Jon Stewart,"Forgetting about the fact how f*cking weird it is that the news is selling you a book about news they should have told you was news a year ago for free, it’s just fun to watch them not just continue to push this book in light of this difficult news, but to also frame this difficult news as more of a reason to buy this book."
Jon Stewart,"I wonder if Truth Social sent him a security alert. ‘We noticed some suspicious humanity on your account. If this was in fact you, President Trump, please reply ‘Nancy Pelosi’s husband is gay.'"
Jon Stewart,"To be fair, I think if Biden was in Stage 9, we should have found out about that."
Jon Stewart,"And he’s the one that’s fine, right? There’s no book coming out on him."
Jimmy Fallon,"Apparently Tom just performed his most terrifying stunt ever, he flew into Newark Airport."
Jimmy Fallon,"To him that’s a stunt. To the rest of us, that’s boarding group D on Sprit Airlines."
Jimmy Fallon,"Meanwhile for another stunt in the movie, Tom had to hold his breath for over six minutes. Once again, for him that’s a stunt, for New Yorkers that’s riding the subway."
Jimmy Fallon,"Two hours. At a certain point, Putin was like, ‘Ugh, this could have been a hacked email.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"The Knicks eliminated the Boston Celtics to advance to the next round. And after the game, things got crazy. Rowdy Knicks fans went down to Penn Station and caused $3 million worth of improvements."
Taylor Tomlinson,"The app is called Closure, but I think it should be called And Another Thing…"
Taylor Tomlinson,The only difference is that the chatbot and the person who ghosted you is that the chatbot can’t run or distract you with its body.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Yeah, great idea, Fortnight , let Darth Vader say stuff. Because if there’s one thing I know about gamers, they are super respectful."
Taylor Tomlinson,"Darth Vader’s voice actor James Earl Jones had signed over his voice rights for future Star Wars productions but I don’t imagine his voice would be used like this, okay. This is like donating your body to science and finding out they’re using your assh*le to develop funnier farts."
