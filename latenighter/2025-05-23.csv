Jimmy Kimmel,"Man oh man, if this is the beautiful bill I’d hate to see the ugly one."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I’m not sure which part of the bill is the beautiful one. I don’t know if it’s the one where we take food from hungry kids, or the devastating effect it will have on college education, or the trillions of dollars it will add to our national debt, or the over $700 billion in cuts to Medicaid. Either way, say goodbye to grandma."
Jimmy Kimmel,You think this has anything to do with Trump letting a kid named Big Balls fire all the air traffic people?
Jimmy Kimmel,"And when you do call, introduce yourself by saying, ‘Hi, I’m the dumbass who didn’t get vaccinated for measles.'"
Ronny Chieng,"But maybe BBL was a better name, because this bill is big and mostly ass."
Ronny Chieng,"Wow, cutting health care and food stamps to people with tax cuts. The only way this could be more cartoonishly mean to poor people is if it says Bob Cratchit has to work on Christmas Day."
Ronny Chieng,"Do you realize how much four trillion is? No, of course you don’t, because none of it went to education."
Ronny Chieng,"What’s the benefit to making it slightly cheaper to buy silencers? I mean, is there as assassin out there who’s like, ‘I’ve got my shot lined up but first let me call my accountant to see how this affects my deductions.'"
Ronny Chieng,"I mean, maybe it’s better silencers are more affordable. Now when a mass shooter is going through a classroom, the other classrooms can keep learning."
Stephen Colbert,"With the FAA snafus recently, airlines are bracing for ‘the summer of hell.’ Or, as Spirit Airlines calls it, summer."
Stephen Colbert,"At this point, it’s not even safe to feed your baby. ‘And here comes the airplane—Oh God, Oh God! No, his mouth is Newark, pull up!'"
Stephen Colbert,"The weakened value of the dollar is making overseas travel more expensive for Americans. Which explains why Delta has launched their new international flight classes, economy minus, dog crate plus, and standing with the creature on the wing of the plane."
Stephen Colbert,"We also have an update on Trump’s interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C. former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, seen here swearing she’s good to drive."
Stephen Colbert,"To be fair, I get why she’s upset. Without water in her glass, it’s harder for her to pretend that she’s not drinking vodka."
Jimmy Fallon,Fleet week really is so much fun. It’s a great chance for people to meet service members and check out all the latest planes from Qatar.
Jimmy Fallon,"Over 200 crypto bros in one room. Even Satan’s like, ‘Now that’s hell.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Kim Jong Un was furious after he witnessed a brand new 5,000-ton destroyer capsize during a launch accident. The North Koran navy was like, ‘Sorry sir, the ship looked much sturdier on Temu.'"
