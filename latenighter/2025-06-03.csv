Seth Meyers,"Wow, he usually doesn’t announce when he’s leaving,"
Seth Meyers,"President Trump on Friday hosted a farewell ceremony in the Oval Office for Elon Musk, and presented him with a golden key to the White House. A golden key? I swear, everything Trump learned about being a rich guy, he learned from Saturday morning cartoons. I’m surprised he doesn’t show up to work in a top hat and a monocle. Seth Meyers"
Seth Meyers,"It only works on one door, and that’s the door that lets you the f*ck out of here."
Seth Meyers,"It’s wild that this guy arrived in Washington to cheers from conservatives and now he’s leaving with plummeting sales and a black eye. Although based on how he waved a chainsaw around like a night club lumberjack, I guess he should just be happy he still has all his limbs? Seth Meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Musk claims he got the black eye because he told his son to punch him in the face, and then his son did. I’m sorry, why is this guy considered a genius? I mean, my boys love me, but all they’re ever waiting for in regards to punching me in the face is an invitation. Seth Meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Um, um, a 5-year-old punched me and… okay, fine, it was a baby. A baby punched me… back. A baby punched me back."
Jon Stewart,He’s leaving his job to make more family with his time. Jon Stewart
Jon Stewart,"Go ahead, punch me in the face."
Jon Stewart,"Oh, don’t worry, it’s nothing weird, it’s an overabundance of ketamine."
Jimmy Kimmel,Key to the White House
Jimmy Kimmel,Stephen Miller freaked out when he heard Elon Musk was in the Oval Office with a black eye. He thought they said “Black guy.” It was quite a relief when he saw his face. Jimmy Kimmel
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump was effusive in his praise for Musk. He thanked him for working “Tirelessly.” Well, yeah, of course he was working tirelessly. He was gobbling down 20 different kinds of uppers every day. Jimmy Kimmel"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Over the weekend, The New York Times published a crazy story about Elon Musk, claiming among other things, he was taking ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, pills believed to be adderall, and so much ketamine he told people it was affecting his bladder control. Which is a delightful detail. Between him and Trump, that Oval Office has got to smell like an abandoned nursing home. Jimmy Kimmel"
Stephen Colbert,"But the weirdest part about this weird meeting was Elon’s face. Because for some reason, he had a black eye. Oh, no! If only someone in the White House had access to makeup! Stephen Colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"So why the black eye? Who hates Elon Musk enough to punch him in the face? I’m no Sherlock Holmes, but could it be… Everyone? Stephen Colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"Okay, buddy, you know the drill: Put on your pjs, brush your teeth, and walk up to the biggest daddy in this room and punch him right in the face."
Stephen Colbert,Elon might seem a little eccentric because he is absolutely zooted to the gills on vitamin freak Stephen Colbert
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was like, “If you need some cover up, I have tons of it. Orange number 36, I have autumnal squash, I have a baby pumpkin… Jimmy Fallon"
Jimmy Fallon,"Honestly, it’s jarring to see Elon’s face with any color. Jimmy Fallon"
Jimmy Fallon,"Elon claims the bruise was a result of his kid punching him while they were horsing around. One of his kids punched him, which narrows it down to about 100 suspects. Jimmy Fallon"
