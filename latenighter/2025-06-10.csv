Taylor Tomlinson,"I just don’t know to make it funny,"
Taylor Tomlinson,I don’t think any of it is funny.
Taylor Tomlinson,"Late-night shows aren’t funny anymore anyway. We’re just the news now,"
Taylor Tomlinson,I don’t know. I just have a hard time talking about any of this stuff because I don’t think it’s funny. I can’t imagine being somebody whose mom or dad or brother or sister got abducted by ICE and then you turn on TV and it’s just some dumb bitch in a ponytail saying: ‘Trump’s just being silly.’ I don’t know how to make it funny. It’s not funny.
Taylor Tomlinson,How are day laborers at Home Depot possibly hurting Americans?
Taylor Tomlinson,Yes! Yet another lawsuit against Trump because he didn’t ask for consent.
Jon Stewart,"Home Depot? ICE, if you’re looking for help in arresting people, you know those guys are looking for work."
Unknown,"We cannot just give up and let this guy do whatever he wants to this country. You can’t have America without immigrants. That would be like, I don’t know, having Epstein’s flight logs without Donald Trump."
