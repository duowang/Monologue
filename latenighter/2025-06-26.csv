Jimmy Fallon,"Mamdani is 33 years old. After he won, he was like, ‘My seven roommates are never gonna believe this!'"
Jimmy Fallon,"33 years old. That’s a good age, ’cause he knows the meaning of both the spending cap and ‘no cap’."
Jimmy Fallon,"How hot was it? Today in Central Park, any man who tried riding the metal horses on the carousel can no longer have children."
Jimmy Fallon,It was so hot today OnlyFans is only selling fans.
Jimmy Fallon,"How hot was it? On my way into work, I saw a squirrel icing his nuts."
Jimmy Fallon,It was so hot I spent the day sweating like a ‘Love Island’ contestant trying to read a book without pictures.
Jimmy Fallon,"It was so hot, I was sweating worse than Andrew Cuomo’s campaign manager."
Jimmy Fallon,It’s been three days of relentless heat. Now I know what it feels like to be a 7-Eleven hotdog.
Jimmy Fallon,"Skimpy men’s swimsuits are making a comeback. Yeah, men’s Speedos are super popular now — well, as long as the pool is heated."
Stephen Colbert,"Cuomo raised over $36 million, while Mamdani relied on volunteers and a relentlessly positive campaign based on issues that affect everyday New Yorkers like freezing the rent, no cost childcare, and free buses… I, for one, cannot wait to get my free bus."
Stephen Colbert,That can’t be easy for Cuomo to admit. ‘Cause touching young people? Kind of his brand. Allegedly. Stephen Colbert
Stephen Colbert,Mamdani generated excitement among minority groups and electrified younger voters. While older voters still run on diesel.
Stephen Colbert,"It’s New York Pride Week… The time of year when we celebrate the LGBTQ community and also when my kids tell me to please stop saying ‘Slay the house down boots. Yaaas, mama.'"
Seth Meyers,"During his concession speech, Cuomo said that mamdani put together a great campaign and added, ‘he touched young people and inspired them and got them to come out and vote.’ Cuomo’s mistake was waiting until after he was elected to touch young people."
Seth Meyers,"On the bright side for Cuomo, at least he doesn’t have to move to New York City."
Seth Meyers,"Yeah, it would really be a travesty if Donald Trump, pictured here holding up a giant menu of weapons he was selling to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, didn’t win a Nobel peace prize. Classic peace prize stuff here."
Seth Meyers,"There’s no one who deserves a peace prize more than Trump? Gandhi never won a Nobel Peace Prize. Doesn’t matter what the award is. They could be up against each other for a Tony, and I would still say Gandhi should definitely win."
Seth Meyers,"If you ask me, no president should get a Nobel peace prize. I don’t think Obama should have gotten one either, especially at the beginning of his term. I mean, that’s just kind of jinxing it. You don’t give out the world series trophy in the first month of the season, otherwise The Mets would be ten-time defending champs."
Seth Meyers,four or five times”] “You can’t win the Nobel peace prize four or five times… [Trump] thinks it’s the Nathan’s hot dog eating contest. ‘A lot of people have been saying I’m like Joey Chestnut but for peace. He eats 50 hot dogs and I cut 50 peace deals and I also eat 50 hot dogs.’
Seth Meyers,"A leaked Pentagon report suggests that Saturday’s air strikes against Iran set the country’s nuclear program back by only several months, which doesn’t seem that long until you remember that Trump has only been president for several months."
Seth Meyers,McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme announced yesterday they will end their partnership. And I’m not surprised. I’ll bet both of those companies have ended thousands of partnerships.
Seth Meyers,"A video has gained attention online that shows a woman complaining that she was reprimanded at Disney World for wearing leggings and a sports bar to the theme park, which is pretty ridiculous considering the employees are walking around without pants."
Seth Meyers,"The New York Times published a report this week about a facility that Amazon is building in Indiana to develop an artificial intelligence system that matches the human brain. So, yeah, it’ll still say ‘Irregardless.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"According to the State Department, the number of U.S. citizens moving to Mexico is up by 70%. And it’s not just Mexico: People are also going to Spain, Italy, France, the Netherlands. Your main export is now yourselves."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Superman [David Corenswet] and Lex Luthor [Nicholas Hoult] are here. We also wanted to book Krypto the Super Dog, but sadly, he’s playing beer pong with Jimmy Fallon."
