Ronny Chieng,"The attorney general said the client list was on her desk. Let me guess, your desk also hung itself?"
Ronny Chieng,"Pam Bondi was supposed to release the pedophile list. If we wanted an attorney general to cover up sex crimes, we would have stuck with Matt Gaetz!"
Ronny Chieng,"At this point, it’s like the only way we can learn who is a certified pedophile is if Kendrick Lamar makes a song about them."
Ronny Chieng,"Yes, a peace prize nomination from Netanyahu is very meaningful. Right up there with a husband of the year nomination from O.J. Simpson."
Ronny Chieng,"Mr. Netanyahu, let me tell you something: If you think you can get Trump to keep sending military aid to Israel by sucking up to him, well, guess what? You can expect that money in your bank account by close of business."
Ronny Chieng,A senior government official says the TSA will no longer require travelers to take off their shoes at security checkpoints… Ending this policy is long overdue. It’s 2025! Terrorists don’t crash airplanes anymore. Boeing crashes airplanes.

Unknown,"Trump has been riding high after Congress passed his ‘Big Beautiful Bill.’ This bill gives $100 billion to I.C.E., kicks 17 million Americans off their health care, and cuts food assistance for kids. At this point, the only bill that’s f*cking more young people is Belichick."
Unknown,"One part of the bill that’s getting a lot of attention is that it gives families $1,000 for each new baby. Yes, the parents of every baby born from now through 2028 will receive $1,000. Which means our nation’s most valuable resource is Nick Cannon’s nut sac."
Unknown,Trump’s media company has just made their streaming platform Truth+ available worldwide. They also announced that Truth+ will be the first streaming network to call BET+ the N-word.

The Search for O.J.’s Gold. Dog the Bounty Hunter’s Roadkill Kitchen. RuPaul’s Normal Guys Dressed in Khakis Race. Dumb [bleep] Dynasty. and White-ish."
Unknown,"The measles are back. There have been over 1,200 cases of measles in the U.S. this year alone. But RFK Jr. is hoping to get that number way up."
Unknown,"We thought we got rid of measles in the year 2000, and now it’s back. In retrospect, that’s like if Lou Bega were to return with Mambo Number 6 ."
Unknown,"Prime Day is doing some good. This year, proceeds from every purchase you make will go to pay off that Jeff Bezos Illuminati wedding orgy."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Pope Leo is reportedly taking a six-week vacation. Yes. Hold on—he’s taking six weeks off? Who the hell does he think he is, Jimmy Kimmel?"
