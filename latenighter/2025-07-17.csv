Stephen Colbert,"He’s right. The Epstein saga is a total snooze-fest. The most powerful man in the world is blocking information about a cabal of the rich, the famous, and the royal, befriending a con man, who regularly flies off on his private plane to his private island to do super illegal sex stuff. Then the con man is arrested, people are afraid he’s gonna name names, but before he can, he mysteriously dies right after being taken off suicide watch in a federal prison during the administration of the guy who is blocking the release of the information. Boring! Sex cults and murder are famously dull. That’s why they called that movie Eyes Wide Shut. ‘Cause everyone was asleep. Stephen Colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"So, Trump is trying to make this go away, but that’s not going to be easy. Because in a new poll, just 3% of U.S. adults say they’re satisfied with the information released about Jeffrey Epstein. Three percent, which means Trump’s handling of the Epstein files has the exact same rating as Battlefield Earth does on Rotten Tomatoes. Stephen Colbert"
Stephen Colbert,"If you insist on asking me about Jeffrey Epstein, please turn in your MAGA hat, your golden shoes, your golden watch, your Trump golden guitar, and also immediately delete any NFTs you have of me as laser eyes, Top Gun moon man, or outer space lion tamer. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Stephen Colbert (as Trump)"

Jordan Klepper,"Can we have some decorum here, please?"

Seth Meyers,"Talk about it less,” he says something that makes you want to talk about it more. “We have to stop talking about it. This is a man who died in prison, or so they say. You know, there’s a minute of security camera footage missing, which is very strange. I mean, how did that happen? Anyway, we’ve got to move on."
Seth Meyers,"He also has a new theory about what’s going on with those mysterious Epstein files. They were actually created by Democrats to damage him politically, which makes total sense to me. Everyone knows the number one rule when you manufacture dirt on a political opponent is: do not release it to the public! Seth Meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Yeah, it’s just a Democrat hoax, a fiendish plan perfectly executed by those dastardly masterminds in the Democratic Party. You know, the guys who didn’t even know which candidate they were running five months before the election. Seth Meyers"
Seth Meyers,"They, those people, manufactured a bunch of secret Epstein files, put Donald Trump’s name all over them and then, what? Instead of releasing them to hurt Trump, they just misplaced them? Is that why Chuck Schumer always has his cheaters on? He’s looking for the file? Seth Meyers"
Seth Meyers,Not like a friend of mine. He’s somebody that I know.
Seth Meyers,I was surprised he was appointed.
Seth Meyers,Former presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy launched a billboard ad this week in Times Square encouraging New Yorkers to flee New York before Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor.

Seth Meyers,"New York City was hit with heavy rains this week that caused parts of the subway to flood. And frankly, it was just nice to see liquid on the subway and know where it came from. Seth Meyers"
Seth Meyers,"Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday that he will run for mayor of New York City as an independent, in the most awkward video of all time. If he looked any more uncomfortable, he could be one of his interns. Seth Meyers"
Jimmy Fallon,"Weaklings who have bought into B.S. Hook, line, and sinker."
Jimmy Fallon,"Wow, that is so out of character for him."
Jimmy Fallon,Finally. This is the cover-up everyone should be talking about.
