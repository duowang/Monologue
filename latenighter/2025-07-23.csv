Jimmy Fallon,"Today while speaking to reporters at the White House, President Trump called the Epstein files controversy a witch hunt. Yeah, a witch hunt… as in it’s a hunt for which files contain Trump."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yeah, he called it a witch hunt…. When they heard, Glinda and Elphaba were like, ‘Leave us out of this, dude.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"But Mike Johnson said, ‘Don’t worry. We will not deal with this the moment we get back.'"
Jimmy Fallon,"Meanwhile, the Justice Department said that they plan to meet with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. When asked about it, Trump said it sounds like an appropriate thing to do. He was like, ‘Hell, I met with her hundreds of times.’"
Jimmy Fallon,"A new report found that the fittest city in America is Arlington, Virginia. Once again, the least fit city is Manboob, Iowa."
Stephen Colbert,"According to court records, Trump flew on Epstein’s plane at least seven times. Now, that doesn’t mean he did anything illegal, but it’s not a great look when you fly on the pedophile’s plane enough times to earn diamond pervert status."
Stephen Colbert,"According to Senator Dick Durbin, back in March, 1,000 FBI agents were put on 24-hour shifts to review approximately 100,000 Epstein-related records and instructed to flag any documents that mentioned Donald Trump. That is a suspiciously Herculean effort. ‘All the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t hide who Dumpty humped with his friend.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Even MAGA is demanding answers. Eleven congressional Republicans have said they will join Democrats to vote to release the Epstein files. That would be a majority of Congress. So in response, today, Speaker Mike Johnson shut down the House until September to block a vote on the Epstein files. It’s a common parliamentary maneuver known as blla-la-la-la-la-la-la-la."
Stephen Colbert,Wow. It takes confidence to call a former president ‘sedaytious.’ Because that is not a word.
Stephen Colbert,"‘Yes he was. He was sedaytious. He would sedate everyone around him with those long pauses of his, then boom, he and Michelle steal the election with a series of thoughtful Netflix documentaries.'"
Stephen Colbert,Thank you… Everyone wants to go to the zoo to see the endangered animal.
Stephen Colbert,"According to leading meat economists, in the past year, the average price of a pound of ground beef rose nearly 12%, and the average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8%. Which explains Arby’s new slogan: ‘Arby’s: We have the bun.'"
Unknown,They cleared out Congress for the summer like they found a dookie in the pool!
Unknown,"You haven’t talked to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s accomplice? The woman he’s in the most pictures with? Wouldn’t she be your first witness?"
Unknown,"How funny would it be if the FBI gets there and she’s like, ‘I’m finally ready to talk, I’m finally ready to tell you everything.’ But then at the last second, she grabs one of the agent’s guns and takes herself out? The FBI would have to come out like, ‘Okay, okay. I know how this looks, but I swear, I swear. Here’s how much I want you to believe me. We did do the first one.'"
Unknown,"‘Sedaytious?’ It feels like he’s mispronouncing a new Black friend’s name. ‘I want you to meet my friend, Se-day-tious!’ ‘Thanks. It’s Sean.'"
Unknown,"The problem with this distraction is that it’s so old, Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t date it."
Unknown,"I cannot stress how big of a deal this is. Because they never admit that Trump has anything but impeccable health. Usually, they bring out a doctor to be like, ‘Donald Trump has big muscles and a girthy-ass dick. Medically speaking, he makes Hercules look like a pig with cancer.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I was wondering if the president cancels his show, does the guest host still get paid?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"And am I in trouble if Jimmy’s show gets canceled while I’m hosting? [Laughter] Hey, thanks for letting me catsit. Oh, also, your cat’s dead."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Just a little fact check. Jimmy Kimmel is not the next to go. Apparently he already went, like a month ago. He is doing shrooms at Six Flags right now."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Just wait until the president finds out that Jimmy hired a substitute lesbian. That’s right. I’m a DEI hire. [Laughter] Well, except for the ‘D.’ I haven’t seen a ‘D’ since I was in junior high school. Hey, come on now!"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I mean, what an insane day to become a late-night host. I think we can all agree I’m getting into the game at the perfect time. I feel like a waiter who just walked up to a couple’s table right after they broke up. ‘Hey, my name’s Fortune, I’ll be your guys—oh, eww, okay. You know what, I’ll just come back.'"
Jimmy Kimmel,"‘Superman’ was the number one movie again this weekend, and people cannot seem to get enough of his adorable pet dog, Crypto. So much so that Google searches for dog adoptions went up by more than 500% after the movie came out. Awesome. But a word of warning before you go out and do something rash. I adopted a bat after I saw The Dark Knight, and I may have started COVID."
Seth Meyers,"In a post Sunday on Truth Social, President Trump celebrated six months of his second term and said, ‘Wow, time flies.’ Does it, though?"
Seth Meyers,"During a breakfast in the Hamptons this weekend, former Governor Andrew Cuomo said that New York City hasn’t had a competent mayor since Michael Bloomberg. And if there’s someone who has his finger on the pulse of what everyday New Yorkers need, it’s a guy having breakfast in the Hamptons."
Seth Meyers,"The NYPD harbor unit arrested a naked man over the weekend after he allegedly stole a dinghy on the Hudson River. The dinghy was safely secured, and so was the boat."
Seth Meyers,"Organizers hosted the Swingathon Festival for swingers over the weekend in the U.K., which included sex games, foam parties, and as many as three women."
Seth Meyers,"King Charles last week named his wife, Queen Camilla, the Vice Admiral of the United Kingdom in honor of her 78th birthday. Not to be outdone, President Trump has finally named First Lady Melania as his emergency contact. ‘She probably won’t pick up first time you call.'"
Seth Meyers,Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met yesterday with Philippine President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr. That story again: Bongbong met with Beer Bong.
Seth Meyers,"The White House released a memo last week outlining President Trump’s health issues, which said the bruising on the back of his hand is, ‘consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent hand shaking.’ I just love that his followers have to somehow reconcile this idea that he’s this powerful strong man, but also he gets bruises if you touch him. He’s the indestructible savior of America, but also he’s basically a plum.” Seth Meyers"
