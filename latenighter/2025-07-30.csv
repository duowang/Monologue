Seth Meyers,"President Trump was asked during a media appearance over the weekend if he rushed to finish a trade deal with the European Union to ‘knock Jeffrey Epstein’s story out.’ Oh, yeah, I’m sure all the conspiracy theorists and MAGA will stop talking about Epstein now that there’s a new trade deal. ‘So you think Trump was on the list or what?’ ‘Who cares? We can get cheaper sardines from Portugal.’ Seth Meyers"

Desi Lydic,"We’re just used to this now, but imagine if when Obama was in office, he kept flying on Air Force One to open up Pizza Hut–Taco Bell franchises. ‘I want to announce we killed Bin Laden, and the new Chalupa is half price at 3:00 P.M. Live mas! Not you, Bin Laden.'"

Because it says that no disciplinary action should be taken against employees displaying religious items, quote, ‘Such as crosses, crucifixes, and mezuzah.’ Yes, you can display any religious artifacts: crosses, crucifixes, lowercase Ts made of wood, the thing that vampires are scared of, and mezuzah. Maybe two mezuzahs, like this. [Forming a cross.]” Stephen Colbert"

Stephen Colbert,"Now, while it’s true that two months after Kennedy’s 1963 assassination, Congress passed legislation renaming the national cultural center as a living memorial to Kennedy, that was a long time ago. And you know what they say about those who forget the past. They name stuff after Donald Trump."
