David Letterman,Top Ten Things Overheard At The White House Beer Summit
Conan O'Brian,"Earlier tonight at the White House, President Obama had a beer with Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates and the policeman who arrested him. The meeting got off to a rough start when a neighbor called the police to say Gates was breaking into the White House. "
Conan O'Brian,"Conservatives are criticizing Time magazine because they’ve put President Obama on the cover for the 12th time in the last year. Not only that, every week since Obama was elected he’s been on the cover of Black President Magazine. "
Conan O'Brian,This is Obama’s 12th appearance on the cover of Time magazine. This beats President’s Bush’s record of 11 appearances on the cover of MAD magazine. 
Conan O'Brian,"The schedule for next year’s Iowa caucuses has been announced, and Jewish voters are upset because the caucus is being held on Saturday, which means they can’t attend. This could reduce the number of voters in the Iowa caucuses by almost two. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Obama had his “beer summit” at the White House. It was his chance to sit down with Dr. Henry Louis Gates, the Harvard professor who was arrested for breaking into his own house, and Sgt. James Crowley, the policeman who arrested him. There was one awkward moment when Crowley asked Obama for ID. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Vice President Biden showed up too . . . I guess they wanted to even things out racially. 
Jimmy Kimmel,They sat around a table in the rose garden and drank. I’m starting to think Obama cooked this whole thing up because he didn’t want to ask Michelle if he could have a poker night. 
Jimmy Kimmel,Tomorrow will be known as “Racial Harmony Hangover Day.” 
Jimmy Fallon,Well President Obama held his first “beer summit” at the White House today. Obama wanted Bud Light; Crowley wanted Blue Moon; Gates wanted a Red Stripe. And Joe Biden wanted whatever fits in his beer helmet. 
Jimmy Fallon,"The ""beer summit"" was good, but we all know the best stuff goes down at the ""after-summit.” "
Jimmy Fallon,Obama wants to make this a regular thing . . . he's already invited Ahmadinejad over for appletinis. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday, Vice President Joe Biden held a series of closed-door meetings. Not because they were secret, he just couldn't figure out how to open the door. "
Craig Ferguson,"The X Games start in L.A. today. BMX racers, skateboarders, and motocross dudes all compete to win a golden bong. "
Craig Ferguson,I love watching people test the limits of their bodies. The X Games is like Cirque du Soleil with better music. 
Craig Ferguson,The only event I don’t like is when the skateboarders grind down the stair rail. It makes a very annoying sound. It’s like the Jonas Brothers. Very annoying.
