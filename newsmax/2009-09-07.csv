Craig Ferguson,There’s a big brouhaha going on at the Venice Film Festival. The guests this year were Michael Moore and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez — the guy who called George Bush “el Diablo.” People were saying that the festival never should have invited that crazy America-hating lunatic . . .or Hugo Chavez. Neither one. 
Craig Ferguson,Summer’s over. You can tell fall’s coming — the Baldwin brothers are storing extra food in their cheeks. 
Craig Ferguson,Happy Labor Day. Today’s the day we celebrate the American workforce . . . so CBS forced me to work. 
Craig Ferguson,Labor Day started so we all could get unbeatable prices on mattresses.
