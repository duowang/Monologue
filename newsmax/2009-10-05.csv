David Letterman,Top Ten Questions To Ask Yourself Before Adopting a Monkey
Conan O'Brian,"Over the weekend, President Obama celebrated his 17th wedding anniversary. The President celebrated by going out for a romantic candlelit dinner with just his wife and Oprah. "
Conan O'Brian,"Forbes magazine is reporting that Oprah Winfrey lost $400 million last year. Oprah is claiming she didn’t “lose” the $400 million, she just forgot which jacket pocket it’s in."

Jay Leno,It’s been reported that the group President Obama is most popular with is the Jewish community. The group he’s least popular with? The International Olympic Committee. 
Jay Leno,The Olympic Committee voted against Chicago as the place for the 2016 Olympics. I guess the committee thought Chicago already has enough amateur athletes with the White Sox and the Cubs.

Jay Leno,The saddest part about Chicago not getting the Olympics? Former Gov. Rod Blagojevich already sold 10 front row seats for a hundred grand apiece for the opening ceremonies.

Craig Ferguson,Three Americans were awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine today. Brazil got the Olympics; we get the Nobel Prize.

Craig Ferguson,"Also today, swine flu vaccinations start. Doctors receive it first; they’re the only ones who can afford to go see the doctor. "
