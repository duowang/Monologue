Conan O'Brian,Temperatures here were once again in the 40s last night and now another rainstorm is expected to drop a half inch of rain on L.A. by the morning. So I guess this is goodbye.

Jay Leno,"A lot of people don’t understand why President Obama won the peace prize. You know something, look around you. Peaceful. Went to the mall this week. Peaceful. Open house by my house. Not one person came in. It’s a peaceful economy we live in."

David Letterman,Top Ten Text Messages Sent By Tiger Woods
Jimmy Fallon,"It was a big day for President Obama. During his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in Norway, Obama stated, “Let us reach for the world that ought to be — that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls.” Obama got those words from his new speechwriter, Ken Hallmark."
Jimmy Fallon,"There’s a new product called ""Texthook"" that lets parents strap phones to strollers so they can text while pushing their children. The most common text message is, “OMG, just crashed my baby into another baby!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"The elementary school in Indonesia where President Obama went as a child, just unveiled a statue of him as a 10-year-old. It's very realistic — in fact, today Joe Biden spent like 20 minutes talking to it. The sculptor said he worked on it for like two months. But after he finished the ears, the rest took like five minutes."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday, citizens of Norway woke up to a weird swirling blue light in the sky, which the Russian Defense Ministry later claimed was due to a failed missile test. Oh, thank God. I was worried it was a UFO. Nice to know it’s just a renegade Russian missile."
Jimmy Kimmel,Another woman has just emerged who claims she had an affair with Tiger Woods. What a fun thing this must be for Tiger Woods. It’s like he cracked open a piñata and the fun never stops.
Jimmy Kimmel,This morning President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize. He angered some Scandinavians when he left right after the ceremony. Usually the winner stays and has dinner with the committee. I don’t think it’s a good time to make Scandinavians angry . . . not after Tiger was caught cheating on his Scandinavian wife . . . he could wind up with a golf club through the windshield of Air Force One.
