David Letterman,Top Ten Signs Sonia Sotomayor Is Getting Cocky
Conan O'Brian,"Yesterday in Washington, President Obama was in the middle of giving a speech when his teleprompter fell to the floor and shattered. Meanwhile Joe Biden's teleprompter has been treated for exhaustion. "
Conan O'Brian,"Sonia Sotomayor’s confirmation hearings are well underway. Political experts say that if Republican senators attack Sonia Sotomayor too harshly, they could alienate Latino members of their own party. This may explain why Republicans opened every question with, “As a huge fan of Santana . . .” "
Conan O'Brian,"More details are coming out about Judge Sotomayor: Apparently, she’s a big New York Yankees Fan. This is good news for the Yankees because apparently they really need a strong lefty off the bench. "
Conan O'Brian,Former President George W. Bush released the final list of all the guests who stayed overnight at the White House when he was president. The most frequent visitor was someone known as “The Wiggles.” 
Jimmy Kimmel,"The death of Michael Jackson continues to be at the top of the news. He meant a lot to a lot of people. I mean, Sarah Palin quit her job because of it. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Now Sarah Palin and her husband are holed up in their igloo listening to “I Can’t Stop Loving You” over and over again. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Both his sister, Latoya Jackson, and his father, Joe Jackson, think Michael was murdered. At the top of their list of suspects? Joe and Latoya Jackson. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"There are all sorts of crazy rumors going around about Michael Jackson. One of them is that his brain is someplace other than with the rest of his body. I don’t know who has it, but I do find it a little suspicious that Donald Trump is suddenly able to moonwalk. "
Jimmy Fallon,President Obama attended the All-Star Game in St. Louis today. He was there to give a 10-run bailout to whoever was losing in the ninth inning.

Jimmy Fallon,"Democrats want an investigation into a secret CIA program that was concealed from Congress by Dick Cheney. It was so secret that Cheney could tell you about it, but then he’d have to take you hunting. "
Jimmy Fallon,President Obama’s teleprompter fell to the ground and shattered during a speech about the economy yesterday. Even speeches about the economy are crashing. That’s bad. 
Craig Ferguson,Today is the greatest day ever — it’s National Nude Day. 
Craig Ferguson,"No, it’s a great day because it’s Bastille Day. Bastille Day was the beginning of the French Revolution. It was a period of turmoil for France. Napoleon turned up as a hero for a while, then he was kicked out. Then they decided they wanted him back so they put him on at 10 o’clock on NBC . . . "
Craig Ferguson,"French revolutionaries heard there were political prisoners inside the Bastille, so they broke into the Bastille with a battering ram made of soft cheese. Much of my research is done on Wikipedia. "
Craig Ferguson,"When they got inside, they found out there weren’t any political prisoners, just drunks, thieves, and sexual deviants — like the cast of “60 Minutes.” "
