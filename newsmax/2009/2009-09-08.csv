David Letterman,There’s a new study of the most stressful cities in America. No. 1 was Los Angeles. Honestly? What? “Oh my God . . . the Perrier is flat!” 
David Letterman,Top Ten Surprises In President Barack Obama's Message To Students
Conan O'Brian,"President Obama delivered a speech to America’s school children on the first day of school, and he encouraged them to work hard and study hard. Then he said, “if that doesn’t work, grab a seat next to the Asian kid.”"
Conan O'Brian,"Then he told them, ""Be careful what you post on Facebook."" Obama then told them about bad things that could happen, like the time he accidentally “friended” Joe Biden."
Conan O'Brian,Obama said if he could have dinner with anyone in history he would pick Gandhi. He says he picked Gandhi so he’d get to eat two entrees.
Conan O'Brian,"Yesterday at a press conference, George Clooney was answering questions when one reporter took off his clothes and professed his love to Clooney. Witnesses say they’ve never been more embarrassed for Wolf Blitzer. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Obama addressed school children on C-SPAN to emphasize hard work and the importance of education. For some reason, that caused a lot of controversy. Some accused the president of trying to brainwash our kids into getting an education. Some people said that his advice, to work hard, stay focused and make sacrifices was an insult to former President Bush."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Some parents actually kept their kids home from school so they wouldn’t see it. If I was a kid, being told I wasn’t allowed to see the speech would be the only reason to watch it in the first place. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Why would they be worried about something kids normally wouldn’t be paying attention to anyway? 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Sadly, because of the current budget crisis, President Obama announced that kids’ allowances would be slashed by 50 percent this year."
Jimmy Fallon,"During his speech to America’s schoolchildren, President Obama said that “what you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country . . . But no pressure.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"The president also told the kids that if they study hard, the United States will continue to prosper. Then he added, “But just to be safe, bone up on your Chinese.” "
Jimmy Fallon,In the speech Obama asked kids to “stay home from school” when they don’t feel well. At that point the children gave Obama a 10-minute ovation. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Congratulations to Judge Sonia Sotomayor. Today was her first day on the Supreme Court. It was so sweet, her parents waited with her at the bus stop saying, “Make friends!”"
Craig Ferguson,"When kids went back to school yesterday, they got a surprise: President Obama gave a speech just for them. As predicted, a lot of people are throwing a hissy fit over his speech. One Republican said Obama was using the speech to push his socialist agenda. Yeah . . . and I suppose telling kids not to do drugs is pushing his healthcare reform. "
Craig Ferguson,Some Republicans were so mad they had Dick Cheney give a rebuttal — he showed kids the proper way to stuff a geek’s head into a locker. 
Craig Ferguson,"Whether you voted for Obama or not, his life is a shining example of the power of education — he was born in Kenya; he studied seven days a week learning how to forge Hawaiian birth certificates . . ."
Craig Ferguson,Obama has other speeches planned this week. The next is for Congress. Congress and school children are very different of course . . . one is an unruly bunch of maniacs who pick their noses and read at grade-school level . . . the other is school children.
