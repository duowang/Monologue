Conan O'Brian,"While he’s in New York for the U.N. conference, Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi is traveling with an entourage of 50 attractive female bodyguards. The guards are there in case Gadhafi gets attacked or in case he wants to make a music video from 1985."
Conan O'Brian,"Yesterday, President Obama welcomed the members of the U.N. General Assembly to New York and he said, “I’d like to encourage you to do some shopping while you’re here.” I think it worked, because China immediately bought eight banks, two car companies, and the state of Wyoming."
Conan O'Brian,"According to The New York Times, Manuel Zelaya, the recently deposed president of Honduras, is holed up with supporters who don’t bathe, eat only rice and beans, and one guy who hasn’t changed his Che Guevara T-shirt in days. So basically, Manuel Zelaya is holed up in a freshman dorm room."

Jimmy Fallon,"It’s fall in New York. It’s getting dark earlier; the temperature is dropping; the leaves are changing. In fact, the only thing that hasn’t changed is Gadhafi is still talking at the U.N."
Jimmy Fallon,"In Gadhafi’s rant, he referred to President Obama as ""his son."" Then he went on to describe Joe Biden as his ""weird, talkative cousin.”"
Craig Ferguson,The season premiere of “The Mentalist” was on last night. The mentalist is a detective whose powers of observation are so great that people think he’s psychic. It’s a fantastic show. I’ve never seen it. 
Craig Ferguson,"The mentalist is so observant, it’s like he can tell what people are thinking. He’s like a woman in a man’s body. "
Craig Ferguson,I wish I could read minds. Remember the movie “What Women Want”? Mel Gibson played a guy who reads the minds of women. Apparently they want an anti-Semitic drunken maniac.
