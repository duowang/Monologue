David Letterman,Top Ten Things Never Before Spoken By A Hockey Player Presented By The New York Rangers 
Conan O'Brian,"President Obama and Oprah Winfrey are going to Copenhagen this week to push for Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics. The bad news is, while they're gone the country’s going to be run by Joe Biden and Jerry Springer."
Conan O'Brian,"According to intelligence reports, the new standard procedure for al-Qaida operatives is to hide explosives inside their rectums. Either that, or they're just playing a cruel practical joke on Akmed."
Conan O'Brian,"Sarah Palin has finished writing her memoirs, and her publisher says, “It’s her words, her life, and it’s all there in full and fascinating detail.” Then he said, “Or so I’m told — I wouldn’t read this thing if you put a gun in my mouth.”"
Conan O'Brian,"A new book about why women have sex claims that women’s reasons differ from pleasure to obligation to even “feeling sorry for the guy.” After hearing this, men everywhere said, “Whatever . . .” "
Jay Leno,"President Obama coming under fire because he has only spoken to the U.S. commander in Afghanistan once in the last six months. Whose fault is that? If the general wants to talk to Obama, get a talk show. That’s how it’s done. "
Jay Leno,"To be fair, President Obama said he’s been busy lately, but he would be willing to add the general as a Facebook friend. A new book is coming out by a John Edwards campaign official. In it he says there’s a sex tape of John Edwards and his mistress. People are stunned by this — what, John Edwards letting someone else in front of the camera!? "
Jay Leno,"In the tape, John Edwards screams out his own name. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday the Senate Finance Committee rejected the Democrats’ healthcare plan, the one with the public option. Meanwhile, the Republicans are offering their own plan entitled “Stop Crying & Take an Advil.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Nancy Pelosi attended the U2 concert last night in Washington, D.C., as Bono’s personal guest. She had a great time. The whole night she was on the verge of making an expression. "
Jimmy Fallon,U2 even dedicated a song to her face — “Stuck In a Moment You Can’t Get Out Of.” 
Jimmy Fallon,"Michelle Obama told Prevention magazine that at 45, she wants to be in the best shape of her life. Meanwhile, Joe Biden told the magazine that at 63, he wants to be in the shape of a unicorn. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland. This is the guy who pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in the ‘70s. He fled to France to avoid possible incarceration. He was in Zurich to accept an award. They’re very clever — they sold him he was getting a “Soul Train” award. 
Jimmy Kimmel,He might be extradited to the United Sates. His lawyers are fighting it on the grounds that he won an Oscar. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Apparently, much of Hollywood agrees with him — more than 130 people signed a petition demanding his release. Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, Debra Winger, Harvey Weinstein David Lynch, and Woody Allen all signed. I think Woody should have sat this one out . . ."
Jimmy Kimmel,"In other news, the Wisconsin Tourism Federation has changed its name to the Tourism Federation of Wisconsin. They changed it because its initials were WTF, and thanks to text messaging, that could mean something else. "
