Jay Leno,"Some pictures of President Obama on the Internet seem to show the president looking very thin. People are saying that he looks too thin.

We used to take a hovercraft to cross the channel into France, until they built the tunnel, or as it’s called, the “chunnel.” They weren’t going to build it because, and this is true, the English were worried about French rats coming to England. Some actually did make the trip, but they tasted the English food and they scurried back."
