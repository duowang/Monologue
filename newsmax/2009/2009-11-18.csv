Jimmy Fallon,"We’re celebrating NBC’s Green Week here at Rockefeller Center. And what better way to celebrate than by ripping a giant tree out of the ground, covering it with lights, and leaving them on for a month?"
Jimmy Fallon,"President Obama visited the Great Wall of China. He said, “It's magical. It reminds you of the sweep of history.” When George Bush visited, he said, “It’s magical. It reminds you of something Spider-Man would love to climb.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"In a new interview President Obama said that the people ""could lose confidence in the U.S. economy"" if our debt continues to grow. And Americans were like, ""Uh . . . way ahead of you, dude."""
Jimmy Kimmel,"Sarah Palin’s new book is getting a lot of attention primarily because she spends a lot of time settling scores with the media, the political elite . . . she’s angry at the weather for raining on her once . . ."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Oddly, Palin goes after vegetarians. She says that if God hadn’t intended for us to eat animals, why did he make them out of meat? "
Jimmy Kimmel,"This is how I see it: People are made out of meat . . . so are cocker spaniels. I guess the lesson here is, don’t go to Sarah Palin’s house for Thanksgiving. "
Jimmy Kimmel," Palin says that women are held to a higher standard than men. She quotes Margaret Thatcher who said, “If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman.” It’s an interesting theory. I guess that’s why she asked a woman to write the book for her.
