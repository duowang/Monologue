David Letterman,"There’s a new tape from Osama bin Laden. This time, he’s blaming the United States for global warming. Sounds to me like someone’s looking for a Nobel Prize.

David Letterman,Top Ten Things You Don't Want To Hear From Your Coach Before the Super Bowl 
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Super Bowl is a day that Americans celebrate the physical accomplishments of world class athletes by dipping fried chicken in Ranch dressing.
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"The first ever tea party convention is going on right now in Nashville. The tea partyers are a group of Americans who think the government is too big, and also like to party and have tea."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Their featured speaker is Sarah Palin. They say she’s getting a $100,000 to be there: $98,000 for wardrobe, $2,000 to speak. "
Jay Leno,"For the second time  since he became president, Barack Obama slammed Las Vegas by saying, “You don’t blow a bunch of cash in Vegas.” The way the government is spending, I’d rather take the odds in Vegas.

"
Jay Leno,"What the president said was, if you want to gamble, drive a Toyota.

Scientists in Australia announced that within five years they will be able to successfully carry out a pig-to-human lung transplant. People could be part human, part pig. We have that already, I think it’s called John Edwards.

Jay Leno,"
Japan has invented a machine that you put 40 sheets of regular paper into and it converts them into rolls of toilet paper. It’s actual paper that you can use as toilet paper. Or, as we call it here, “an NBC contract.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"President Obama was busy holding two fundraisers in D.C. last night. During one of his speeches, Obama told the crowd, “We can’t be afraid of the future.” Most Americans agree with him, mainly because they’re so busy being afraid of the present.   
 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"Obama said, “We can’t be afraid of the future.” And Biden was like, ""What about clowns? Can we be afraid of clowns?""    
"
Jimmy Fallon," 
President Obama also said that the key to competing with China is to improve our math and science education.  Because right now, our GDP is about $13 trillion and China’s is $3 trillion, which means we’re still ahead by . . . trillion.  
"
Jimmy Fallon,"The “Obama Store” in Washington D.C. is closing. That’s where they sell T-shirts, hats, and calendars with Obama's face on them. You can tell they’re Obama calendars, because they only go up to 2012."
Craig Ferguson,"The last time the Super Bowl was in Miami, I was there. Miami is a great mix of young people and old gangsters. The best part is seeing the old mob guys in thongs. 
"
Craig Ferguson,"
The Super Bowl is the most watched event on TV. It’s nice that Americans can all agree on sitting down and watching two groups of huge men beat each other up. 

"
Craig Ferguson,"
The commercials coming up on this show will not be as good as those on the Super Bowl, because the commercials are a reflection of who is watching the show. So enjoy the ads for hemorrhoid creams."
