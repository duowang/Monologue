Jimmy Kimmel,"Sarah Palin is shopping a reality show. She quit as governor to follow in the footsteps of Ray J and the Kardashians.

New York Gov. David Paterson lied under oath about getting free Yankees tickets for the World Series last Fall. Paterson, who is legally blind, maintains that he didn’t even know he was at a Yankees game.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Tiger Woods’ caddy, Steve Williams, said he had no idea Tiger was fooling around with other women. He said he was disappointed in Tiger but is standing by him as  a friend, and the source of all of his income.

The only caddy that should be disappointed is the one that Tiger drove into a tree.

General Motors announced that they’re recalling 1.3 million compact cars in North America to address a power steering problem. Apparently, since President Obama took over the company, all of the cars are veering to the left.

In the Democratic gubernatorial primary, Texas voters overwhelmingly nominated former Houston mayor Bill White over Pakistani-born businessman Farouk Shami. Who could have seen that coming?

There’s a new vending machine in Japan that can wash, rinse, and blow-dry your dog in 30 minutes.  They have the same exact thing in China, but it doubles as a snack machine.

Craig Ferguson,"It’s not a great day for California State Sen. Roy Ashburn. He was pulled over for a DUI and it turns out that he was drinking in a gay nightclub. All I can say is “thank you,” Sen. Ashburn, because until now, it’s been a very slow week.
"
Craig Ferguson,"
Ashburn voted against every single gay rights measure. Maybe he was at the night club to protest the gay lifestyle. However, he tested positive for “Appletini.”

"
Craig Ferguson,"
There is a theory that Ashburn could be a closeted homosexual, and he may also be a hypocrite. Hypocrisy at this level is like seeing Mel Gibson at a synagogue.
