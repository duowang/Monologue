David Letterman,"The Academy Awards show was so long this year that they had to keep adding to the montage of dead actors.

David Letterman,Top Ten Things Overheard At The Academy Awards
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s exhausting winning an Oscar. First you have to do a speech, then you have to do interviews, take pictures, then you go to parties to do more interviews and more pictures, then you have to do drugs . . . 
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
In the morning, after the parties, you wake up with Oprah.

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"The winner was “The Hurt Locker.” No Academy Award-winning movie has ever been seen by fewer people. I think two people saw it.
"
Jay Leno,"Kathryn Bigelow won Best Director for “The Hurt Locker,” about the Iraq war. But she forgot to thank the two people without whom this film could have never been made: Bush and Cheney.
"
Jay Leno,"
It was a very long show. Halfway through, you could see the Botox start wearing off.
"
Jay Leno,"
As you know, this year they expanded the Best Picture category to include 10 films. In fact, even the death montage was expanded to include President Obama’s healthcare program.

"
Jay Leno,"Former Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry is 74 years old. He’s getting up there. The nurse has to cut his crack into little pieces now. 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"Did everyone watch the Oscars last night? Or as I like to call it, James Cameron's own personal ""Hurt Locker.""

"
Jimmy Fallon,"
It was a big night for ""The Hurt Locker,"" which, of course, is a film about the war in Iraq. I guess that explains why Obama called the director and was like, ""Uh, how did you end it?""
"
Jimmy Fallon,"
President Obama is going to hold a major “space conference” to unveil an ambitious new plan for NASA. Obama called it “One small step for man, one giant distraction from healthcare, two wars and the recession.”

"
Jimmy Fallon,"At Obama’s space conference, he plans to tell the world that he wants to put a man on Mars. The man he wants to put there? Joe Biden."
Craig Ferguson,"The oldest person in America passed away today at the age of 114. She was only 98 when the Oscars started.
"
Craig Ferguson,"
In most cultures around the world, old people are respected. Here, we honor them by taping them doing stupid things and putting it on Youtube.
"
Craig Ferguson,"
Denial of death is very big in our culture. In fact, we all die eventually. We’re not all going to keep going and going. We’re humans, not Toyotas.
