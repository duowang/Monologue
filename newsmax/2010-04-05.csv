Tiger Woods gave a press conference ahead of his return to the Masters. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing really did. It was a lot like watching golf."
Jay Leno,"About 30,000 people showed up at the White House for the annual Easter egg roll. Or as Fox News called it, a “socialist free food giveaway.”

During the quake, I did what I was supposed to do, I immediately ran into the bathroom and cried. Stop, drop, and cry.
