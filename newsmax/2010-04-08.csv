Jimmy Kimmel,"I watched golf today. It’s boring. There was no sex at all, just a bunch of middle-aged white guys and one guilty-looking black guy walking around.
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
Tiger Woods returned to golf today. President Obama and Russian President Medvedev signed the necessary documents and just like that, relations have been normalized.

Bristol Palin is continuing her campaign about teen pregnancy. It’s funny that she’s going around telling kids not to get pregnant when her mom is telling people, “Drill, baby, drill.”

Bristol was a pregnant teen herself. She named her baby “Tripp,” with two p’s, which is reason enough for teens not to have kids.

Jay Leno,"The mayor of L.A. wants to shut down city agencies two days a week. I have a better idea — why don’t we shut down the mayor’s office five days a week?

Jimmy Fallon,"Tiger Woods made his return to golf at the Masters today. While talking about Tiger, the tournament chairman said, “This year will not be just for him, but for all of us who believe in second chances.” Then someone whispered in his ear and he was like ""I'm sorry — 17th chances. All of us who believe in 17th chances.""

Jimmy Fallon," 
United Airlines and U.S. Airways are in talks to merge, creating one of the world’s largest airlines. You know how this works, first the merger will be announced. Then it’ll be delayed. Then they’ll give everybody a free hotel room and then you’re on standby for another announcement.

Apple is admitting that its iPad sometimes has a hard time connecting to the Internet, and some people are returning them. That’s just wrong. If I returned everything that had trouble connecting to the Internet, my grandparents would be in big trouble.

Craig Ferguson,"President Obama signed a historic treaty with the Russian president. Fox News said it was a summit between a powerful communist leader and the president of Russia. 
"
Craig Ferguson,"
The treaty is about reducing the number of nuclear weapons we have pointed at each other. I thought we were friends with the Russians but we’ve really been “frienemies” this whole time.

"
Craig Ferguson,"
When I went to Moscow, I saw the tomb of Lenin. They keep his body preserved in a glass coffin. It’s waxy, it’s falling apart — it’s like Joan Rivers after a Brazilian."
