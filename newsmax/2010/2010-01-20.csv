David Letterman,"It's raining like crazy in L.A. and there's flooding everywhere. So I'm thinking to myself, ""Whoa! It's a good thing Conan is getting sandbagged."""

Jimmy Kimmel,"The cable news networks are talking about how much Obama's approval ratings have dropped, but rest assured, he is still the most popular African-American president in American history.
