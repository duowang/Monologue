Craig Ferguson,"They say that handguns were very rare in the South of France, where Vincent van Gogh lived. They raise a fair question: Who would give a gun to someone so insane to cut off his ear?

Craig Ferguson,"If van Gogh was with us today, I wonder what he'd say? What would you say? “What? I can't hear you.”

Craig Ferguson,"
The best way to experience van Gogh's achievements is to go to the van Gogh museum in Amsterdam. When I was there I stood in front of the paintings and actually wept. I think I was overpowered by the sheer beauty of his vision. Or perhaps it was the mushrooms.

Craig Ferguson,"
It's mind boggling that van Gogh never sold a painting in his lifetime. The truth is, in terms of art, most of us don't know what we like until someone tells us. We're afraid of looking stupid. I'm obviously not. That's why I do this show."
