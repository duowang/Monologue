Conan O'Brian,"It’s Tuesday. That means another woman has come forward to accuse Herman Cain of sexual harassment.


"
Conan O'Brian,"According to a new poll, 42 percent of Americans say they are uncomfortable with the idea of having a Mormon president. When asked why, the people said, “We're still getting used to having a Muslim president.”

"
Conan O'Brian,It's been announced that Oprah is going to receive an honorary Oscar. The award is in the category of “Oprah Winfrey Called and Decided She Wants an Oscar.”
Jay Leno,"Herman Cain said he would be willing to take a lie detector test. But that's kind of a double-edged sword. If he fails, his career is over. And if he passes and it turns out he's not a liar, he's obviously not cut out for politics. 

"
Jay Leno,"A new poll taken abroad found that President Obama's policies are more popular overseas than they are here in America. That's because he's created more jobs overseas than here in America. 
"
Jay Leno,"The White House says there is no evidence at all that earth has been visited by aliens. Do you believe that? We can't even find aliens sneaking across the border.

Jimmy Fallon,"
A man in Connecticut claims that he won last week’s $254 million Powerball, but lost the ticket. I know how he feels. The other day I lost an umbrella — so annoying!
 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, a man says he lost his winning Powerball ticket. Or as that guy’s dry cleaner put it, “I didn't find it anywhere. And I checked my new beach house, my new private jet, and my hovercraft.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,"A 1,300-foot wide rock just missed the earth and not a single one of us even looked up from our cell phones to see it. We only care about flying objects when they're angry birds. 

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
The asteroid missed the earth, fortunately, but the president had Bruce Willis, Michael Bay, and Aerosmith standing by just in case.

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"There's a fifth woman that claims to have had a problem with Herman Cain. If this keeps up, it seems very unlikely he will be president, although it seems more and more likely he will become governor of California.
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
Nancy Grace was brutally eliminated from the dancing competition and she's not going to rest until she finds out who did it. But at least now Nancy can go back to doing what she does best, which is not dancing."
