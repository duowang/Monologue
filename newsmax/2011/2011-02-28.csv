Everyone is saying we have to take control of Moammar Gadhafi. We can’t even control Charlie Sheen.
"

Charlie Sheen says that his show will be back and that he’s a man of his word. I believe that word is “crack.”

Craig Ferguson,"A town in Arkansas has had three earthquakes in under 24 hours. They think it could be due to removing waste water which is known as “fracking.” I don’t know what fracking is, but I sure enjoy saying it.

"
Craig Ferguson,"I thought the Oscars were supposed to be young and hip and I only saw all these old people. Then I realized I was watching “60 Minutes.”

Twitter was down for two hours on Saturday. It was terrible. I had to call random people in the phone book and tell them what I had for lunch.

"

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
“True Grit” should have been in the Best Foreign Film category because I couldn’t understand a thing Jeff Bridges said.
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
Charlie Sheen has officially gone crazy, and not just a little crazy. Even Gary Busey thinks he’s nuts.
