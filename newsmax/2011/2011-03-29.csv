Jay Leno,"We’re down to the final four now. Only four Middle East countries we haven’t attacked.

"
Jay Leno,"
President Obama spoke about our role in Libya. He’s not sure when the war will end, what happens when we win, or how much it will cost, but other than that it was quite informative.
"
Jay Leno,"
Obama is being criticized by both parties for not having a clear strategy to get out of Libya. But neither does Moammar Gadhafi, so it’s OK.

"
Jay Leno,"Whole Foods, the organic grocery chain, is putting bars in some stores that will serve beer and wine. Their goal is to get you so drunk that you don’t notice the prices."

Donald Trump showed his birth certificate to reporters. Who cares about his birth certificate? I want to know if that thing on his head has had its vaccinations.

Prince William had a bachelor party at a hidden mansion. Things got pretty crazy. At one point, William drank a glass of sherry and didn’t put his pinky up.

"

Jimmy Fallon,"President Obama’s speech on Libya was scheduled early so it wouldn’t interrupt “Dancing With the Stars.” That’s ridiculous. This is a major historical event that affects the lives of millions of people. I can’t believe it was almost interrupted by Obama’s speech.
 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"The latest episode of “Dancing With the Stars” was preceded by Obama’s new show, “Dancing Around the Objectives in Libya.” 

"
Jimmy Fallon," 
Critics were saying Obama seemed defensive and slightly angry during his speech on Libya. Sounds like somebody’s March Madness bracket isn’t doing so hot.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Natalie Portman’s body double from “Black Swan” said the actress only appeared in 5 percent of the full-body dance scenes in the movie. How do we know it’s Natalie’s body that’s actually pregnant now?

Jimmy Kimmel,"Britney Spears is on the show. The whole city of West Hollywood has moved east to see her.
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
This is actually Britney’s second appearance at the show, after a long time. She hasn’t been here in about two kids.

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
Britney’s fans need a good nickname, just like Justin Bieber’s fans are called “beliebers.” I think they should be called “spear-leaders.”"
