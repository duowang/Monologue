"
Conan O'Brian,"The raid on bin Laden was carried out by an elite team of Navy SEALs called “Team 6.” Not only did they kill bin Laden, they also killed Donald Trump’s shot at being president.

"
Conan O'Brian,"Trump said that he hoped bin Laden suffered a lot. It looks like he got his wish, because the CIA said bin Laden spent his last hour watching “Celebrity Apprentice.”"
Jay Leno,President Obama has done something that no one else has been able to do. He got Donald Trump to shut up. 
Jay Leno,"Saddam Hussein is dead, and Osama bin Laden is dead. If you’re Moammar Gadhafi, living in exile is starting to sound really good. "
Jay Leno,"NATO bombed Gadhafi’s compound in Tripoli. The bombing damaged countless antique rugs and curtains, leaving Gadhafi with absolutely nothing to wear. "
Jay Leno,"The Journal of Animal Ethics says that it’s insulting to call animals “pets,” and they should be called “animal companions.” They say “pet” is the most insulting thing you could call an animal, except in North Korea, where they’re called “dinner.” "

The doctor is always giving me advice to cut down stress. He said I should go somewhere peaceful where no one will bother me. I said, “How about a walled compound in Pakistan?”

"
Jimmy Fallon,"Southwest Airlines closed a $1 billion deal yesterday to buy AirTran. Yeah, that’s a smart business move — eliminate the only airline that was keeping you from being the world’s worst airline.
 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"In the wake of bin Laden’s death, the NBA has announced that it will use metal detectors at all playoff games to screen for weapons. Or as the players put it, “Uh oh."""
Jimmy Kimmel,"The initial reports said that Osama bin Laden was killed by Navy SEALs, but now it appears that he was killed by actual seals.

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
This is the best time ever to be a Navy SEAL — or a guy in a bar claiming to be a Navy SEAL.
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
The CIA says bin Laden’s last words were, “Are you guys here about the dishwasher?”
