Cyber Monday is a day that every store online puts everything on sale. It's basically Black Friday for people too lazy to put on pants.

"

There are some things that you can get on Black Friday that you can’t on Cyber Monday, like being pepper sprayed in the face.

"

"
Craig Ferguson,"
I don’t think it’s healthy how the holiday sales start on Thanksgiving night. You shouldn’t spend Thanksgiving night in stores fighting with strangers. You should be at home, fighting with your family."
