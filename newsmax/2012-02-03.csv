David Letterman,Top Ten Super Bowl Fun Facts
Jay Leno,"President Obama spoke at the national prayer breakfast. The president said that his Christian faith is the driving force behind his economic policies. So I guess instead of blaming Bush, it's now all Jesus’ fault. 


"
Jay Leno,"Obama said that he says a brief prayer every morning, but then Joe Biden shows up anyway. So I don't know if it would really work.

Mitt Romney is taking a lot of heat for saying he's not concerned with the very poor. I don't think he helped himself, either. Like today he says he does care about the homeless — especially the summer home-less.

"
Jay Leno,"The House of Representatives has passed a bill that prohibits people from using welfare money in strip clubs or liquor stores. I agree with that. Strip clubs and liquor stores should be off limits for people who get government funds — you know, like congressmen."
Jimmy Fallon,"Food truck vendors here in Indianapolis have been trained to look for suspicious behavior during Super Bowl weekend. You know, like a truck selling Korean tacos in the middle of Indiana.

Jimmy Fallon,"It turns out that the owners of the Patriots and the Giants have each donated $5,000 to President Obama’s campaign. Which explains why Fox News is predicting that both teams will lose the Super Bowl.

Jimmy Fallon,"I read about a guy here in Indiana who built an exact replica of Lucas Oil Stadium, using 30,000 Legos. It’s pretty cool. And this is even cooler: He had enough Legos leftover to build himself a girlfriend.

Jimmy Fallon,"The movie “Big Miracle” came out, about some people trying to save a group of whales. Of course you may be familiar with the TV version — “The Biggest Loser.”"
Craig Ferguson,"The big reason people love the Super Bowl is the food. It's a big day for eating. People go all out with snacks on Super Bowl Sunday. This year I'm making a replica of the palace of Versailles out of baloney. 

"
Craig Ferguson,"This year's game is expected to be the most watched TV show in history. So remember, car thieves, Sunday night is the best time of year to go to work.

Craig Ferguson,"
The Super Bowl halftime show one the most amazing feats of engineering. The crew has less than 20 minutes to deploy a complex system of rigging, cranes, and pulleys. And once they get Madonna in her corset, they have to put up the stage. "
