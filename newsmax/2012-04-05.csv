Conan O'Brian,"The Mega Millions controversy is getting stranger by the day. The Maryland woman who claims she is the winner held a press conference where she not only failed to present the winning ticket but quickly asked the press to leave. In other words, she is full of mega B.S. "
Conan O'Brian,"Even though this woman claims she won, surveillance footage shows the ticket was purchased by a man. Either she is lying or we're all trapped inside a new Tyler Perry movie."
Jimmy Kimmel,It was opening day for baseball today. Remember baseball? It used to be our national pastime before Facebook. 
Jimmy Kimmel,I'm glad baseball is back. I was getting sick of paying only $2 for a beer.
Jimmy Kimmel,"China has overtaken the United States as the world's biggest food and grocery market. That means they buy and consume more food than we do. Which — when you think about it — of course they do. A half hour after they eat, they're hungry again. It's Chinese food. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Last year, China spent $964 billion in groceries, whereas we only spent $908 billion. China has a billion people. We have 300 million. Why weren't they always the biggest market for groceries? Are they allowed to eat now? "
Jay Leno,"The earth's population is now well past 7 billion people. And still, the Republicans can't find one candidate they really like."
Jay Leno,"Rick Santorum's campaign is now formally calling on Newt Gingrich to drop out of the race. But you know Newt. He has vowed to stay in. And believe me, when Newt Gingrich takes a vow, he keeps it — unless, of course, you know, marriage."
Jay Leno,"President Obama signed a bill preventing members of Congress from profiting from insider trading. Didn't you think that was already illegal? 

"

Craig Ferguson,The woman who says she bought the winning Mega Millions ticket now says she's hidden it inside the McDonald's where she works. That's the dumbest plan I've ever heard. Doesn't she already know there's a hamburglar already inside the building?
Craig Ferguson,Google announced they are making glasses that have embedded technology that projects data on the lenses in front of your eyes. Some people formed a group online to stop the new technology. An online group to stop new technology — does anybody see the irony here? 
Craig Ferguson,"The protesters say Google is underestimating the dangers of merging man with machine. Well, they're a little late to stop that half-man, half-cyborg thing. They're already here. One of them just captured the Republican nomination."
