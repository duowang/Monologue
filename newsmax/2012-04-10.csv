Craig Ferguson,"It is a tough day for Rick Santorum, who suspended his presidential campaign. I don't think it's a coincidence that he dropped out the day hot dog pizza was announced. Seeing this abomination, Rick realized that humanity has veered just too far off the path of moral righteousness."
Craig Ferguson,Hot dog pizza raises two important questions. Who came up with this monstrosity? And how quickly can it be delivered to my house?
