Jay Leno,"The average wedding now costs $27,000. Well, no wonder Newt Gingrich is broke. He's constantly shelling out all that money."
Jay Leno,"Newt Gingrich's campaign paid $500 to get his name on the Utah primary ballot, and the check bounced. You know, if Newt is spending money he doesn't have, maybe he really is qualified to be president."
Jay Leno,"The price of gasoline has now doubled under President Obama's administration. He and Jimmy Carter are the only presidents ever to have had that happen. But in fairness, at least under President Obama we don't have to listen to disco."

Craig Ferguson,Bird-like dinosaurs were found with eggs. It is a big deal because fossils of dinosaurs and their eggs have never been found in the same place. I think it is nice that scientists found the eggs on Easter week. 
Craig Ferguson,"If I were one of the scientists, I would have played a trick on the others and secretly switched the dinosaur eggs with Cadbury's Creme Eggs."
David Letterman,Rick Santorum has dropped out of the race. He wanted to ban gambling and outlaw pornography. And this is a guy who claims Romney is out of touch with America.

Jimmy Fallon,Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal announced that he is supporting Mitt Romney for president. Jindal said he couldn’t think of a better way to show his support than waiting until Romney was the only guy left.
Jimmy Fallon,"After dropping out of the GOP race, Rick Santorum emailed his supporters to ask for help paying off his campaign debt. So if you believe in his message of responsible spending and no handouts, just give him a handout to cover all his irresponsible spending."
Jimmy Fallon,"Harvard Law School will soon offer a class called ""Understanding Obama"" — while Barnum & Bailey Clown College will offer a class called ""Understanding Biden.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Another strange story from Arizona. A bill signed by the governor would declare a woman to be pregnant two weeks before conception. So congratulations, ladies, you are all Arizona pregnant. "
Jimmy Kimmel,I wonder if they realize in Arizona that they will not be able to report any female illegal immigrants because they are all pregnant with babies who will be citizens. 
Jimmy Kimmel,Florida congressman Allen West made an interesting statement yesterday. He believes there are about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party who are members of the Communist Party. Really? I think it's time for someone to lay off the Tom Clancy novels. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"West is a guy that some think should be Mitt Romney's running mate. I would like that. We haven't had a truly crazy vice president . . . well, until now."
