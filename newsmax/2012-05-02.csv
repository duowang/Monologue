David Letterman,Top Ten Least Inspiring One-Word Campaign Slogans
Jimmy Kimmel,"A lady got arrested for bringing her 5-year-old to a tanning salon. Guess what state she is from — New Jersey. Is that a crime in New Jersey? In New Jersey, I think they call that day care. "

Jay Leno,"Mitt Romney is fighting back at charges by President Obama and Vice President Biden that if Romney were president, Osama bin Laden would still be alive. Romney said if he were president, bin Laden would have died a slow and painful death. He wouldn't have ordered a hit. He would've canceled his healthcare."

Craig Ferguson,"Not such a great day for President Obama. Today he admitted he ""made up"" a girlfriend in his autobiography. It's a good thing Oprah's off the air because this would have gotten him kicked out of the book club."
Craig Ferguson,"Today Travel and Leisure magazine came out with their list of America's best airports. They always give high marks to airports with indoor gardens and yoga rooms instead of stuff that really matters to me, like how quickly I can get out of baggage claim after stealing somebody's suitcase. "
Craig Ferguson,"A Las Vegas airport got the highest marks for quick security. Of course they did. In Vegas, every other person is a stripper. You just whip off your belts and shoes and you're through in no time. "
