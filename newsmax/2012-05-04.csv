Jimmy Kimmel,I would like to wish each of you a happy Cinco de Mayo. I can't believe it's been almost a year since the last time I threw up in a sombrero. 
Jimmy Kimmel,Cinco de Mayo commemorates the victory of the Mexican War. And nothing fills the Mexican community with pride like white people drinking upside-down margaritas at Chili's. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"If it weren't for the Irish and the Mexicans, between the Super Bowl and the 4th of July we would have no reason to get drunk."

Craig Ferguson,"Who else is in this movie? Thor, the dude with long, blond hair and the power of flight. It is like if Fabio could fly."
