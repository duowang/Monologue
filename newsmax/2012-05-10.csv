Conan O'Brian,Mitt Romney has issued an apology for some of his high school pranks that went a little too far. Probably the meanest prank was the time he bought his high school and fired everyone in it.

Jay Leno,"President Obama has come out in support of gay marriage. He said his position has been evolving for years. Miraculously, he saw the light just in time for tonight's big Hollywood fundraiser. What are the odds?"
Jay Leno,"Today Newt Gingrich didn't agree or disagree on the gay marriage thing. However, he did say there should be a term limit on all marriages."

Craig Ferguson,"President Obama's in town for a fundraiser. Forty grand a plate — because nothing says ""man of the people"" like demanding 40 grand for some rubbery chicken."
Craig Ferguson,The guests included Leonardo DiCaprio and Barbra Streisand. It must have been awkward though. Everybody in Hollywood thinks they're the world's most important person. So it must be kind of weird when in walks the world's actual most important person. 
Craig Ferguson,"Insiders say Obama's pretty comfortable around actors. He should be. He has been ""acting"" like he was born in Hawaii for a long time. "
Craig Ferguson,I'm a little surprised how much everyone in show business wants a second term for Obama. An over-hyped sequel with a bloated budget — that's not the Hollywood I know.

Jimmy Kimmel,Time magazine has a controversial new cover. They put it out for Mother's Day. It's a real mom feeding her 3-year-old son. Don't look at it as the source of future humiliation for the boy. Try to look at it as the event that helped shape him into history's most fearsome cage fighter. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"As you might imagine, many people were shocked by the fact that that was the cover of a magazine. If you were shocked by that, you do not want to see what they have planned for Father's Day."
Jimmy Kimmel,"When you see your mom this weekend, thank her for never doing that to you."
