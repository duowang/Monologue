Craig Ferguson,It's a big night for hockey fans. It's game one of the Stanley Cup Finals. The Kings are in the finals for only the second time in their history. What was on ESPN today? — the national spelling bee.
Craig Ferguson,I can't take a position on the hockey playoffs because I've got to be impartial.
Craig Ferguson,"For a while, some schools across the country were banning spelling bees. For obvious reasons, of course — steroids."
Craig Ferguson,"Some people take the spelling bee very seriously. These people are called ""parents of children in the spelling bee."" They're trying to make up for their own childhood of crushed dreams and misspelled words. "
Craig Ferguson,"One thing I've noticed about the spelling bee is everyone in the audience is very, very quiet. I know what that's like, performing in front of a silent crowd. "
