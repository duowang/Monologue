Craig Ferguson,"There is a big Hollywood movie opening — ""Total Recall."" It's a remake of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. It's a movie that asks two haunting questions: ""What is reality?"" and ""Will you pay to see a movie that kind of stunk the first time?"" 

"
Craig Ferguson,The new movie doesn't have Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's got Colin Farrell. I don't think Colin Farrell is a good replacement — because he can act. 
Craig Ferguson,"""Total Recall"" is about a guy who wakes up with no memory, which is a perfect role for Colin Farrell because he's Irish. They're used to it."
Craig Ferguson,"Colin Farrell's character is a spy, and his wife is an assassin who's trying to kill him. That must be why they didn't bring back Arnold Schwarzenegger. He could never relate to a character whose wife wants to kill him."
