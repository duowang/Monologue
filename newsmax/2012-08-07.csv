Conan O'Brian,"It's now come out just before his record-breaking 100-meter dash, gold medalist Usain Bolt ate at McDonald's. Apparently he timed his meal so when the race started he would have exactly 9.63 seconds to get to a toilet."
Conan O'Brian,Olympic officials have disqualified a champion race walker after determining that he was doping. They disqualified him. The man said getting caught doping is almost as embarrassing as getting caught being a champion race walker.
Conan O'Brian,Tough Olympic news for the Romneys. Ann Romney's horse Rafalka did not advance to the Olympic finals. Apparently it was beat by a smooth-talking socialist horse from Kenya.
Conan O'Brian,"Mayor Bloomberg is saying now that he has banned large sodas in New York City, his next target is going to be alcohol. Once that's out of the way he'll start his crusade against the laughter of children."
Craig Ferguson,"The movie ""The Lorax"" is out on DVD today. Danny DeVito is the title character. It's an oddly shaped hairy creature that resembles a small walrus. So is the Lorax."
Craig Ferguson,"Today is the one-year anniversary of those riots in London. If you watch the news today, it seems like the riots are still going on over there. But it's just drunk Australians at the Olympics."
Craig Ferguson,"Today is gymnastics at the Olympics. I used to think gymnastics wasn't a real sport, just an excuse to wear a leotard. But I've learned something. I do not need an excuse to wear a leotard."
Craig Ferguson,I think the scores for Olympic gymnastics are affected by what countries the judge and the gymnast are from. That's wrong. That type of political pandering isn't meant for gymnastic Olympic events. It's meant for the Supreme Court.
