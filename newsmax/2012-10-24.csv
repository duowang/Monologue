Craig Ferguson,"The magazine says, ""Her daytime talk show is quickly making her the queen of the air waves and it has her fellow TV host Craig Ferguson seeing green."" So apparently I'm very jealous of Katie's ratings even though we're on at different times of day."
Craig Ferguson,"By the way, unless I'm mistaken, wasn't Katie pretty successful before I was even on the air?"
