David Letterman,"I heard an update from Con Edison, the electricity company. They said the Republicans now will be without power for the next four years."
Jimmy Kimmel,The U.S. Postal Service announced yesterday they are expecting this year's holiday season to be their busiest ever and also their slowest ever. That's probably the only business in America that complains about being busy. 
Jimmy Kimmel,Still no election results from Florida yet. Florida is the post office of states. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"The election has been over for three days, but already there's a new survey that says Hillary Clinton is favored to win the Iowa caucuses in 2016. You'd think they could have at least waited until we peeled the ""I voted"" stickers off our jackets. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"The survey showed Hillary Clinton with 58 percent of the vote, Vice President Biden with 17 percent, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo at 6 percent, and Massachusetts Senator-elect Elizabeth Warren with 3 percent. A woman who has not yet expressed any interest in running is well ahead of some other people who aren't running. Good study."
Jay Leno,"The head of the CIA and former General David Petraeus has resigned because of an extramarital affair. So guys, let that be a lesson for you. If the CIA director can't keep an affair secret, you don't have a chance."
Jay Leno,"The big story here in Los Angeles is the Lakers have fired their coach, Mike Brown. They are playing so bad that President Obama and Chris Christie toured the Staples Center today. "
Jay Leno,"When reporters asked Brown if he thought he should be fired, he had no defense — just like the Lakers."
Jay Leno,The Lakers are playing so bad that their illegitimate kids now claim the Clippers are their real fathers. 
Jimmy Fallon,"There’s a video going around of President Obama getting choked up and crying while he thanked his campaign staff after the election. When Mitt Romney saw the video, he was like, “What is that clear liquid coming out of his eyes? Is he leaking?”

"
Jimmy Fallon,There’s also a rumor that Romney will write a tell-all book based on the diary he kept on the campaign trail. That's in case you ever wondered what Ambien looks like in book form.
Jimmy Fallon,Yesterday thousands of people complained on Twitter after Facebook went down for 60 seconds. It reminded me of the time my great-grandparents complained about having to make soup out of shoes during World War II. 
Craig Ferguson,"""Skyfall"" opens today. The 23rd James Bond film, and it might be the best. Some people think Roger Moore was the best Bond ever. Those people are called ""Roger Moore."""
Craig Ferguson,"""Skyfall"" is fantastic. I know you're thinking, ""The movie studio's paying you to say that."" No they're not, but I wish they would."
Craig Ferguson,"One of my favorites is the first one, ""Doctor No."" Sean Connery looked so cool, kissing Ursula Andress on that lush tropical island. Not only did Connery play James Bond, but his chest hair doubled as the lush tropical island."
Craig Ferguson,"Every guy in the world wants to be James Bond. Even guys in al-Qaida are like, ""Death to the West. But not 007."""
