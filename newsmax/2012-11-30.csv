Jay Leno,"Lindsay Lohan was arrested for assault in New York City after she punched another woman in the face at a bar at 4 o’clock in the morning. It does not look good for Lindsay. Because of her previous arrest, if convicted she could face some serious jail minutes."
Jay Leno,The good news for Lindsay is at least this incident has drawn attention away from her portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor.

Craig Ferguson,It's like making Donald Trump work on April Fool's day.
