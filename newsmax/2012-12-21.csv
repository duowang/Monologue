David Letterman,It's the shortest day of the year. Now the longest day of the year is any day you have lunch with Regis Philbin. 
Jay Leno,"Well folks, it is December 21, or as the Mayans call it, April Fools Day."
Jay Leno,We have Terry Bradshaw on the show tonight. The only reason we booked him is because we thought the world was going to end. He thinks we are doing a show so now we have to do it. 
Jay Leno,"Tim Tebow and actress Camilla Belle have called it quits. The rumor is, she caught him not having sex with another woman.  "
Jay Leno,Sources say Tim was unhappy because he felt she was using him — and coach Rex Ryan wasn’t. 
Jimmy Fallon," It’s late Friday night, which means the world did not end after all! So the good news is, we’re still here. The bad news, I got A LOT of Christmas shopping to do. "
Jimmy Fallon," Today, President Obama announced that he's giving all federal employees Christmas Eve off. And when Joe Biden heard that he was like, ""But not Santa, right?"" "
Jimmy Fallon," Ireland is coming out with its own version of the show “Cheers.” Yeah, a sitcom about people who sit around drinking at a bar all day — or as they call that in Ireland, “Reality TV.” "
Craig Ferguson,"The Mayan calendar didn't go past Dec. 21, 2012. There is one problem with the Mayan prophesy. It is crap. Every serious Mayan scholar says close reading of Mayan texts reveals they believed the world would go for thousands of years past the end of the calendar. But let's listen to the wacko locked in the basement with 500 pounds of spam because he knows what is going to happen!"
Craig Ferguson,"I've got to admit, I love the show ""Doomsday Preppers."" It's about people making bunkers to survive catastrophes they know will happen. A nuclear war, viral epidemic, Fox canceling ""Glee."" It's all going to happen. "
Craig Ferguson,"Personally, I think people who are panicking about what the Mayans believed says more about our society than it does the Mayans. I don't know really where I'm going with that, but it sounded good, didn't it? It sounded like I was really smart. I've got something to say."
Craig Ferguson,"You know what I really am feeling awkward about? If this is really the end of the world, I'm going to my doom wearing this tie. I'm going off to the hereafter with a tie with a little snowman on it."
