David Letterman,Top Ten Things Your Mother Doesn't Want to Hear on Mother's Day
Jay Leno,I have been busier this week than Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to go shopping for Mother's Day. 
Jay Leno,"For Mother's Day, Hooters is giving away free chicken wings to all mothers who come in. So Take your mom to Hooters. What better way to let her know she's failed as a parent than taking her to Hooters for Mother's Day? "
Jay Leno,President Obama was in town last night for a big fundraiser at George Clooney's house. They want to have a fundraiser with lots of celebrities so the choice is pretty much George Clooney's house or Promises rehab center in Malibu.
Jay Leno,Today Mitt Romney apologized for holding down Michele Bachmann's husband and cutting his hair.
Jimmy Fallon,"Sunday is Mother’s Day. My mom’s the best — for years, she fed me, washed my clothes, read me bedtime stories. But then last year, I got my own place.  "
Jimmy Fallon,Hooters is offering customers 10 free chicken wings on Mother’s Day. And 45 REALLY uncomfortable minutes with your mom. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Members of the “Geek Squad” are complaining that Best Buy is making them work off the clock. But they got revenge — today, they took a red audio cable and put it in the yellow visual input."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yes, the Geek Squad was forced to work overtime. You can tell they’re busy — in fact, last week they had to cancel nine “Star Wars” re-enactments."
Craig Ferguson,"Sunday is Mother's Day. There's a Jewish proverb that says, “God could not be everywhere and therefore he made mothers"" — which is my favorite Jewish proverb right after ""Stay thyself far away from Mel Gibson."""
Craig Ferguson,"My mother did so much for me. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here. I mean here in California. When I was 40, she kicked me out of the house. She bought me a one-way ticket to Fresno."
Craig Ferguson,"My mother and I have disagreed on some things. But I think that's balanced out by her love, affection, and all those times she posted bail. "
Craig Ferguson,"As I get older, I realize that my mom shaped me into who I am — a bitter, alcoholic comedian."
