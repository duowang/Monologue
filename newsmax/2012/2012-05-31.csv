Jay Leno,New York City's Mayor Bloomberg is cracking down on the most dangerous threat to the Big Apple: sodas.
Jay Leno,"Bloomberg wants to outlaw sodas and other sugary drinks over 16 ounces. I try to limit my sugar intake. That's why I eat little fun-size candy bars. But I eat them 50 at a time. By the time I'm done, nobody's having fun. My almond joy turns to almond shame. "
Jay Leno,Who is this Mayor Bloomberg who thinks he can tell us what we can and can't drink? Probably one of those vegan fascists who drives a Prius.
Jay Leno,"This ban only applies to large sodas, 16 ounces or more. So if sodas were Kardashians, they're really just banning Khloe."
Jay Leno,"New Yorkers, I've got a tip for you. Here is a way to get around the ban. Buy two 12-ounce sodas. All the soda you can drink in exchange for paying twice the sales tax. Bloomberg, you midget genius!"
