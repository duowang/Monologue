Craig Ferguson,"There is a big movie opening today. I'm very excited about this movie, ""Rock of Ages."" It's a musical about the hair-metal bands of 1980s. I'm not the biggest fan of hair metal. How good can a musical genre be when it's known for its hairstyle?"
Craig Ferguson,"A lot of these hair-metal songs were popular because of the video games Rock Band and Guitar Hero. Nothing says rock 'n' roll like playing a video game in your parents' basement. 

"

Craig Ferguson,"""Rock of Ages"" is basically just karaoke for middle-aged people. It's ""Glee"" for dads."
