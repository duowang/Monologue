Craig Ferguson,"I've heard some people criticize the movie ""Brave"" because it has bears in it. They say there are no bears in Scotland, but there are. You just have to know where to look. Try the Revolver Bar. There are a lot of bears there. Buy 'em a drink, they'll let you hibernate in their cave."
Craig Ferguson,"A couple of years ago I did a voice in ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and I'm doing the sequel next. They're from DreamWorks. I worked with DreamWorks and Disney-Pixar, who are supposed to be rivals. It's like an East Coast/West Coast thing. I could end up getting shot by Goofy."
