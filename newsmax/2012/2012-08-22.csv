David Letterman,"We found out early that Kelly Ripa, after five years of searching for a new co-host to replace Regis Philbin, has finally found the guy that's going to take his job, the man who's going to fill his shoes — New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan. They were going to announce it at the Republican convention but we found out. "
Jay Leno,"At a campaign stop in Virginia, Joe Biden said he is such a NASCAR fan, he said, ""I'd trade being vice president in a heartbeat for winning Daytona."" To which President Obama said, ""Deal!"" "
Jay Leno,Happy birthday to gold medalist sprinter Usain Bolt. He turned 26 this week. You know the sad thing? His world record time has already been broken by Republicans running away from Missouri Congressman Todd Akin.
Jay Leno,"The Mars rover Curiosity has sent back images of some odd things on the surface of Mars, and some people think they could be UFOs. Here's my question. If we're on the surface of Mars, aren't we the UFO?"

Jimmy Fallon,Former New York Giant Michael Strahan will replace Regis Philbin as Kelly Ripa’s permanent co-host. Of course it gets kind of weird when you hear that Regis was actually traded to the Giants.

Jimmy Kimmel,Nude photos popped up on the Internet today of what appears to be Prince Harry having a big naked party in Las Vegas. This has caused quite a commotion in London. But I'd be disappointed if my prince WASN'T having naked parties in Vegas.
Jimmy Kimmel,"What's the point of being a prince if you can't round girls up in Vegas and get naked with them? In the olden days, it probably went on every night and if you told anybody about it, they cut your head off."
Jimmy Kimmel,Maybe those poor girls lost their clothes in an accident and the prince graciously gave them his. It's called chivalry. Look it up.
Jimmy Kimmel,I just think it's refreshing to see a famous redhead drunk and stripping that isn't Lindsay Lohan for a change.
