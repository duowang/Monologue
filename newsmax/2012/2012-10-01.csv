Conan O'Brian,"The presidential debate is on Wednesday. Mitt Romney has been preparing for the debate by debating a Republican senator who plays the part of President Obama. Meanwhile, President Obama has been preparing for Romney by debating an ATM machine."
Conan O'Brian,"Tough weekend for Justin Bieber. On the first show of his new tour, he vomited on stage twice. That's right. Even Justin Bieber is sick of Justin Bieber now."
Jay Leno,"Arnold Schwarzenegger gave an interview to ""60 Minutes"" last night. In the interview, Arnold says you can't run from your mistakes. Yeah, especially when they have feet of their own."
Jay Leno,Florida election officials say at least 10 counties have identified suspicious and possibly fraudulent voter registration forms. And they were turned in by a firm working for the Republican Party of Florida. I guess they got suspicious when they realized most of the votes were for Bob Dole.  
Jay Leno,"The man who made that film mocking Islam has been arrested. I don't know if that's a good idea. I mean, if they start arresting everybody in this town who made a bad film, Hollywood is dead. "
Jay Leno,"According to people who are supposed to know these things, we're now entering a worldwide shortage of bacon and pork. Finally, a crisis Al Gore will find even more troubling than global warming."

"
Craig Ferguson,"The part of the book everyone's going to skip to is the part where he talks about the maid and the love child. He says he didn't think the kid was his at first — mostly because the kid could speak English. 

"
Craig Ferguson,"Arnold says in the book cheating on Maria was the stupidest thing he ever did. Excuse me, but I saw ""Jingle All the Way."""
Craig Ferguson,"Despite the scandal, Schwarzenegger was a popular governor. So popular that Republicans wanted to repeal the natural-born citizen law that prevented him from running for president. So a president born in Austria would have been OK, but a president born in Kenya — NO!"
David Letterman,"Isn't it a beautiful day? It's 73 and sunny, just like Kelly Ripa. "

Jimmy Kimmel,I see you all survived Carmageddon. They shut down the 405 highway over the weekend. Even our highways get cosmetic surgeries. Next week Bruce Jenner's face will be shut down for a weekend. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"People here did stay away from the 405 — some because they were worried about traffic, others because they were using Apple maps and couldn't find the 405."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Justin Bieber kicked off his tour in Phoenix Saturday night and midway through the show he vomited on stage. And he didn't just throw up once, he threw up twice. You know that once is an accident, but if it happens twice, maybe the songs are trying to tell you something."
