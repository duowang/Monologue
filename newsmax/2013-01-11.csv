David Letterman,This year nobody was elected to baseball's hall of fame. No player has ever gotten into the hall of fame without winning Ohio. 
Jimmy Kimmel,The Centers for Disease Control announced that the flu has officially reached epidemic status. Epidemics are rarely good. You rarely hear about balloon epidemics.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Our huge state budget deficit is gone. Governor Jerry Brown announced the state budget for next year is projected to net an $851 million surplus and this year we'll have a surplus of $785 million. You hear that, meter maids? Maybe you can stop giving us tickets for a couple of months."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It's a huge achievement for Governor Jerry Brown. Apparently you can get a lot done when you're not walking around saying ""I'll be back"" all the time. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Justin Bieber is being sued by a former bodyguard. The bodyguard's lawsuit claims Justin punched him repeatedly in the chest. He's seeking $420,000. I think I would pay $420,000 to keep the fact that I got beat up by Justin Bieber a secret."
Jay Leno,President Obama will be sworn in with his hand resting on two Bibles. Is that how screwed up Washington is now? One Bible can't get the job done anymore?
Jay Leno,U.S. customs officials recently discovered 310 pounds of marijuana hidden in some frozen carrots. That's one way to keep kids away from drugs — put them in vegetables.
Jay Leno,Carrots and marijuana — how good will your vision be after THIS combination?
Jay Leno,"A former bodyguard for Justin Bieber is now suing Justin Bieber, saying that the star assaulted him. Well, you can see why he's suing. Good luck getting anymore work as a bodyguard when find out that you got beat up by Justin Bieber. "

Craig Ferguson,"There is a big new movie out today that I'm excited about: ""Gangster Squad."" The leader is played by Josh Brolin. He's a real tough guy. He looks like he can go toe-to-toe with even the toughest adversary. That'll happen when your stepmom is Barbra Streisand."
Craig Ferguson,"""Gangster Squad"" is set in 1948, when L.A. was ruled by a ruthless gang that defended its turf with threats and deception. Sort of like the Kardashians, but with better style."
Craig Ferguson,Sean Penn is also in this movie. Sean Penn is a villain who says crazy things and punches out the good guys. I'm not sure what he does in the movie.
Craig Ferguson,Penn plays legendary gangster Mickey Cohen. In the 1940s Mickey Cohen and his gang ran this town. Now it's run by Mickey Mouse and the Disney gang.
