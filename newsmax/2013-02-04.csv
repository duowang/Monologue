David Letterman,Congratulations to the Baltimore Ravens. And congratulations to Ravens coach John Harbaugh. He was named the game's most valuable Harbaugh. 
Conan O'Brian,I lost $200 on last night's Super Bowl. I bet on electricity. I thought that was a sure-fire bet. It never goes out during the Super Bowl.

Jay Leno,"So deer antler spray works. How about that! Congratulations to the Baltimore Ravens, the new Super Bowl champs. But how about that blackout? That’s what happens when Beyoncé actually sings live. "
Jay Leno,"When the lights first went out, out of force of habit Ray Lewis started running from security. "

Craig Ferguson,"What a Super Bowl that was. During the first quarter, Will Ferrell was sitting a few rows in front of me. Channing Tatum was over here and Jay-Z was over there. There were so many important people that I kept waiting for someone to tell me to leave."
Craig Ferguson,"There was a power outage that is still not officially explained. When the lights first went out, it was kind of scary. They thought they'd pop back on, and we'd see one of announcers slumped over with a knife in the back."
Craig Ferguson,"I was with a bunch of CBS people when the lights went out. They were freaking out because when it gets dark around CBS, Dan Marino gets a little frisky."
