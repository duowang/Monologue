Jay Leno,Lent officially began yesterday. Do you know what the Lakers are giving up for Lent? The playoffs.
Jay Leno,"For those of you who are not Catholic, the idea of Lent is you're supposed to give up something so you can experience suffering. Or you could just go on a Carnival Cruise."
Jay Leno,"My heart goes out to those poor passengers stuck on that floating bedpan in the Gulf of Mexico. For four days, 4,000 people stuck on a ship with foul odors, the toilets aren't working, and there's long lines for food. And here's the worst part. The karaoke machine is still working."
Jay Leno,"Donald Trump called the Beyoncé Super Bowl halftime show ""inappropriate"" and ""a national scandal."" Apparently, it lacked the quiet dignity of Gary Busey and Meat Loaf screaming at each other on ""The Apprentice."""
Craig Ferguson,The biggest gifts on Valentine's Day are flowers and chocolate. Because what says true love better than murdering a plant and then making someone fat?
Craig Ferguson,"For me, the best Valentine's Day gifts don't cost anything because they come straight from the heart. That's why I composed a special Valentine's Day poem for you, my audience. ""Roses are red, love's but a fable. I'm really sorry you can't afford cable."""
Craig Ferguson,"Valentine's Day is celebrated a little differently here in L.A. Nobody eats chocolate because of the calories, so people give each other tofu-shaped boxes filled with bean curd. Then they fantasize about what their Pilates instructor would be like if he was straight."

Jimmy Kimmel,"I hear from a lot of women who swear they don't care about Valentine's Day. In my experience, you can tell how much someone cares about Valentine's Day by how much they tell you they don't care about Valentine's Day."
Jimmy Kimmel,A survey by the national retail foundation said that some people even give their fish Valentine's Day gifts. A good way to tell that you've lost your mind is if you give your fish a Valentine's Day gift.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The song ""Gangnam Style"" has been named best song for kids to listen to while brushing their teeth. However, it is the worst song to listen to during everything else."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Personally, I think most parents would rather have all their kids' teeth fall out than hear that song one more time."
