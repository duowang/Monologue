David Letterman,Anybody see the Academy Awards last night? The show last night was so long that by the middle of the show the audience was begging Daniel Day-Lewis to free them.
Conan O'Brian,Welcome to the show. I'm Conan O'Brien — or perhaps I'm Daniel Day-Lewis in his greatest role yet.
Conan O'Brian,Last night a toilet flooded the lobby where the Oscars show was being held. The show won an Oscar for best portrayal of a Carnival cruise. 
Conan O'Brian,"Big winner last night was ""Life of Pi,"" a story of a young man who wakes up in a lifeboat with a hyena, zebra, orangutan, and tiger, which oddly enough, is also the plot of ""The Hangover 3."""
Conan O'Brian,"South Korea's first female president was sworn in. Meanwhile, North Korea said, ""We're just going to stick with men named Kim."" "
Jay Leno,"""Life of Pi"" took home four Oscars. It's about a young boy trapped at sea on a small boat with a man-eating tiger. Yet with all that, it’s still a better way to travel than a Carnival cruise."
Jay Leno,Jennifer Lawrence won for best actress and worst stuntwoman.
Jay Leno,There was one glaring omission in the “In memoriam” reel: Lindsay Lohan's career. Didn’t that die last year? 
Jay Leno,Pizzas in Denmark have been discovered with horse meat. Pizzas with horse meat. How fast does THAT get delivered to your house? 
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night's Academy Awards lasted about three hours and 40 minutes. Even Jennifer Lawrence's dress was like, “That's way too long.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"The entire cast of “Les Miserables” performed a song from the movie, featuring Russell Crowe. Or as the cast of “Zero Dark Thirty” put it, “Now this is torture.”"
Jimmy Fallon,The company that owns Olive Garden announced that its revenue has dropped 5 percent in the last quarter. Which explains their new promotion: limited bread sticks.
Jimmy Kimmel,Last night the biggest stars in the world squeezed into the theater across the street. But it's nice to see our neighborhood getting back to abnormal. 
Jimmy Kimmel,I don't know why the Oscars needs a best actor and actress category. You don't separate best director and best directress. 
Jimmy Kimmel,Daniel Day-Lewis now has one Oscar for each of his names. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Monday night I usually update you on the number of times ""amazing"" is said on ""The Bachelor."" Tonight was 22. We also collected every ""amazing"" that was uttered on or near the Oscars' red carpet. That's 101. There were as many ""amazings"" as there were Dalmatians. Can someone in the world please send us more adjectives. We need them."
