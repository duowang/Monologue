Craig Ferguson,"There is a big movie out today: ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" It's a prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz."" I'm thinking this is a little risky making a prequel to that movie. It is an American icon. That's like the French making a prequel to the Statue of Liberty."
Craig Ferguson,"I hope this movie isn't some hipster version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" where the Tin Man gets taken to the recycling center and the Scarecrow is exchanged for a sparkly vampire."
Craig Ferguson,"James Franco plays the man who eventually becomes ""Oz."" He's a conman who tries to trick gullible people into thinking he has special talents. I don't know what he does in the movie."
Craig Ferguson,"Franco's performance is already generating Oscar talk. As in people saying, ""Hey, isn't that the guy who ruined the Oscars a couple of years ago?"" "
Craig Ferguson,"I feel bad for James Franco, being remembered as the guy who ruined the Oscars. Halfway through he realized that the audience hated him, and then he just gave up."
