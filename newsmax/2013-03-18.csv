David Letterman,I went over to St. Patrick’s cathedral earlier and they're giving away free Pope bobbleheads.
Jay Leno,"To celebrate St. Patrick’s Day, Carnival Cruise had all their toilets overflowing with green water. "
Jay Leno,"You know the whole legend of St. Patrick, right? St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland — and then they came to the United States and became NBC executives. "
Jay Leno,I woke up this morning to the sound of helicopters and police sirens — which of course in L.A. can only mean one thing: Lindsay Lohan's back in court again. 
Jay Leno,Lindsay was late once again for a court appearance by almost an hour. But I blame the judge. Who in his right mind would schedule a Lindsay Lohan court appearance for the morning after St. Patrick's Day? 
Jimmy Fallon,"Happy St. Hangover's Day, everybody. "
Jimmy Fallon,"It is the day after St. Patrick's Day. So if you're just waking up now, I'm sorry, I don't know whose apartment you're in. "
Jimmy Fallon,"The guy who plays Satan on the History Channel's ""The Bible"" looks like President Obama. Even Rush Limbaugh was outraged. He was like, ""How can you do that to Satan?"" "
Jimmy Kimmel,Lindsay Lohan was back in court for a probation violation hearing. She was 48 minutes late to court. What she really needs to steal is a watch. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tiger Woods announced he is dating Lindsey Vonn. So just when you thought Lohan had a lock on the title of Lindsay with the worst judgment, along comes Lindsey Vonn. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tiger said, ""We have become close and are now dating. We thank you for your support and respecting our privacy."" And the best way to keep it private is to post about it on Facebook. "
Jimmy Kimmel,It's nice to see Tiger with a woman not holding a subpoena for a change.
