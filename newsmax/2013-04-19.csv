Craig Ferguson,You know what happened this week in New Zealand? They legalized gay marriage. It was a historic week for gay hobbits. This means Bilbo can finally marry Gandalf.
Craig Ferguson,"There is a big movie opening today. One of them science fiction epics. It's called ""Oblivion"" and stars Tom Cruise. Tom is an intergalactic soldier who spends his days fighting aliens. I have no idea what he plays in the movie."
Craig Ferguson,"I think ""Oblivion"" is going to be a return to form for Tom Cruise. Because he hasn't been in a big-budget fantasy project like this since . . . his marriage."
Craig Ferguson,"It is hard to believe that Tom Cruise is 49 years old. He's the same age Wilford Brimley was when he played an old guy in ""Cocoon."" "
Craig Ferguson,"""Oblivion"" takes place in the year 2077. Humans have abandoned earth. But strangely, Jay Leno is still hosting ""The Tonight Show."""
