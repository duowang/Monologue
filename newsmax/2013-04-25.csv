David Letterman,It was so sunny today that Reese Witherspoon came out of the police station squinting.
Jay Leno,"All five living presidents were in Dallas today for the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library. President Obama said he was happy to support the opening of the library. He should be. After all, Bush got him elected twice. Blame Bush on that one, sir! "
Jay Leno,"In President Bush's high school yearbook, he was voted least likely to have a library named after him."
Jay Leno,"According to a new study, L.A. has the worst traffic in the United States. In fact, traffic is so bad in L.A. that SUV now stands for “stationary utility vehicle.”"
Jay Leno,"The NFL draft was today, which is a huge deal. This is the time when college football players go from being paid under the table to being paid OVER the table. "
Jimmy Fallon,There’s a new iPhone app that tells women where they can buy Michelle Obama’s clothes. Not only that — there's another app that tells men where they can buy Hillary Clinton's clothes.
Jimmy Fallon,"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was in Texas today for the dedication of George W. Bush’s presidential library. The library is already done, but they brought in Christie for a second ground breaking."
Jimmy Fallon,"The stars of “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” have a new project in the works. Yeah, they say they're working on a family cookbook. Which sounds good until you find out that the first recipe is just going to McDonald's."
Jimmy Kimmel,The $100 bill is getting redesigned for the first time since 1996. It has new security features that will make it harder to counterfeit. And this is kind of amazing: Benjamin Franklin's hair is real. You can comb it and everything.
Jimmy Kimmel,NBC has plans for a new game show called “The Million Second Quiz” in which contestants will answer trivia questions 24 hours a day for 12 days straight. Does NBC really expect us to pay attention to something that lasts a million seconds? I can barely get through a 45-second cat video on YouTube.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tonight is the first round of the NFL Draft. What's most entertaining is their names. The number one NFL Draft name for 2013 is Barkevious Mingo. It sounds like a character from ""Game of Thrones."""
