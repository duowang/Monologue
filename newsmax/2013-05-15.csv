"
Conan O'Brian,"Since President Obama took office, the Democratic Party has lost nine governorships, 56 members of Congress, and two Senate seats. In his defense, Obama said, ""Well, I did promise change."""
Conan O'Brian,China announced it will no longer buy recycled trash from the U.S. I don't have a joke here. I'd just like to give a round of applause to whatever genius has been selling trash to China.

Jay Leno,"This week marks the 40th anniversary of the Watergate hearings. For those of you too young to remember, back then the administration had an enemies list. They were spying on reporters, and they used the IRS to harass groups they didn’t like. Thank God those days are gone forever. "
Jay Leno,"A lot of critics are comparing President Obama to President Richard Nixon, which is unfair. Nixon's unemployment rate was only 5 percent. "
Jay Leno,"This whole IRS thing has become a huge story. They apparently were targeting conservative groups like the tea party. You know it's bad when President Obama says, ""Hey, why don’t we talk about Benghazi?"""
Jay Leno,"The National Aquarium in Washington is going to close. But don't worry. If you're in D.C. and you still want to smell something fishy, stop by the White House. They've gone from ""Change you can believe in"" to ""Changing the story until you believe it."""
Craig Ferguson,"The Cannes Film Festival was yesterday. Everyone who's anyone in show business is in France right now. ""But Craig, you're here in Los Angeles."" Exactly. I'm lower on the show business ladder than Justin Bieber's monkey."

Craig Ferguson,"Every year there's a jury at the Cannes Film Festival. Getting on the jury is very competitive in France. Not because the French love cinema, but because they love to judge. 

"
Craig Ferguson,One of the people on the jury this year is Nicole Kidman. She is letting them screen the movies on her forehead.
David Letterman,"Have you folks been paying attention to what's going on in Washington? In a matter of six weeks we have three big scandals, and it looks like President Obama and all his buddies in the White House may go to prison. Finally, some good news for the Romney campaign."
Jimmy Fallon," President Obama is not having a good week. With three scandals shaking the White House, they're saying this is one of the worst weeks of Obama's presidency. Obama was like, “How could things get worse?” And Joe Biden was like, “You rang?” "
Jimmy Fallon,"A town in Minnesota has appointed a 4-year-old boy to be its mayor. People got pretty annoyed when he said his first plan was ""waising taxes."""
Jimmy Fallon,"Next season “Dancing With the Stars” will be cut back from two nights a week to just one — while ""American Idol"" will be cut back from two nights a week to a puppet show at Ryan Seacrest's house."
Jimmy Kimmel,"O.J. Simpson took the witness stand. He's serving up to 33 years on armed robbery, assault, and kidnapping charges. He won't be eligible for parole until 2017 and who knows if we'll have even have ""Dancing With the Stars"" by then. "
Jimmy Kimmel,The most notable thing to come out of the trial is that O.J. has put on a lot of weight in prison. I think he found the real killers and ate them. 
Jimmy Kimmel,He's hoping if he's granting a retrial they'll let him serve the remainder of his sentence under Waffle House arrest.
