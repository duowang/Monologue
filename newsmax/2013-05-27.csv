Craig Ferguson,"It is Memorial Day, when we honor men and women who've defended this country. To them I say thank you. And every year we as Americans celebrate Memorial Day the best way we know how. By having sales at mattress stores and car dealerships."
Craig Ferguson,A lot of Americans got a three-day weekend. Not this American. I've been a citizen for five years. How long before I get the day off?
Craig Ferguson,The only way I can get a day off is if I somehow pre-taped a show. But I just wouldn't do that. 
Craig Ferguson,You know who gets the day off? Jay Leno. He's about to get a lot of days off. 
Craig Ferguson,I probably shouldn't joke about that. Jay Leno might end up hosting this show.
