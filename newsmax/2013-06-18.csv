David Letterman,"This story comes up about twice a year. They think they have located the body of Jimmy Hoffa, the former Teamsters union leader, after 40 years of being dead. Nothing on the NSA whistle-blower, but we think we know where Jimmy Hoffa is. "
Jay Leno,"In a new interview, Ralph Nader said there has never been a bigger con man in the White House than Barack Obama. Can you believe that? Ralph Nader is still alive! "
Jay Leno,"Nestlé has launched a new premium water called ""Resource."" They say it is made specifically for a woman who is a little on the trendy side and the higher income side. ""Resource"" sounds so much better than tap water for women who are really rich and stupid."
Jay Leno,"Have you seen the ads for Endure, a cool towel? They show people sitting in the sun with the thing around their neck, rubbing their faces in it. In each ad they say the towel uses a proprietary fabric technology that activates when wet to cool a person off. So in other words, it's a towel! All towels do that. "
Jay Leno,"""Man of Steel"" is the No. 1 movie. I love how cool Superman's parents were. They knew he was different, but they downplayed it. They didn't want him to be treated special. Imagine if Superman was a kid today. His parents would drag him to school, saying ""Our Clark has a kryptonite allergy. He'll need special meals."""
Jimmy Fallon,"The Senate’s new immigration bill is apparently more than a thousand pages long and weighs 24 pounds. Some critics say the bill is too long for the average American to read before it's approved, while some senators are saying that's the point."
Jimmy Fallon,The immigration bill is more than a thousand pages long. That doesn’t sound like an immigration bill. That sounds like a menu at The Cheesecake Factory. 
Jimmy Fallon,A new study found that volunteering can actually reduce the risk of heart problems. Which would be awesome news if it didn't also reduce the risk of having a fun Saturday.
Jimmy Fallon,"Dunkin' Donuts is redesigning its stores so that customers will want to sit down and relax — because if there's one thing that goes through my mind when I see Dunkin’ Donuts customers, it's, “These people need to move around LESS.”"
Craig Ferguson,"Earlier tonight was the big season finale of ""The Voice."" It was so exciting. I'm glad that guy or girl won."
Craig Ferguson,"Congratulations, winner of ""The Voice."" That's right, whoever you are. I'm sure this year's winner will turn out to be just as big as last year's winner — Cassidy Pope. "
Craig Ferguson,"That's who won last year, Cassidy Pope. I've never heard his or her music. Maybe it's good. But Cassidy Pope sounds like a TV show about a cowboy who rides into the Vatican, becomes Pope, and solves crimes."
