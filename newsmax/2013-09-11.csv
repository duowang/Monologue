Conan O'Brian,Last week Americans viewed 12 times as many stories about Miley Cyrus as they did about Syria. Which is why last night President Obama gave his speech on Syria while rubbing up against Robin Thicke.
Conan O'Brian,"I'm a little bummed out because it looks like the Anthony Weiner madness is finally over. It was so good for talk show hosts, one of the best things that ever happened. As he drove away from reporters, he gave them the finger. So at least he went out with dignity. That's the important thing."
Conan O'Brian,"The new secretary of the Vatican said that celibacy for priests is open to discussion. In a related story, nuns are now allowed to twerk."
Conan O'Brian,This is weird. A brewer has apparently come out with a beer that you can spread on toast. It is said to appeal to a very specific market known as alcoholics.
Jay Leno,"The White House has a new slogan: ""Hope and let the Russians fix it."""
Jay Leno,"Last night President Obama spoke to the nation about Syria. Hopefully, Americans who were confused about the president's plan feel better now, knowing that he's confused too."
Jay Leno,"Well, it was confusing, wasn't it? First, President Obama laid out his reasoning for a strike against Syria. And then he gave the rebuttal."
Jay Leno,"John Kerry has insisted that any military strike on Syria will be ""unbelievably small."" But not as small as the SUPPORT for a strike on Syria.

Craig Ferguson,"Tonight was a very special episode of ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo."" Mama June and Sugar Bear had a commitment ceremony. That's like a wedding but without that old-fashioned crap about being legally required to give away half your stuff. "
Craig Ferguson,"Of course they got dressed up for the commitment ceremony. Camouflage is a bold fashion choice for a wedding, isn't it? Nothing ruins your wedding faster than hunters who think you're caribou. "
Craig Ferguson,The whole idea of a commitment ceremony is not for me. It's usually when married people say they're renewing their vows. And I don't see the point in renewing your vows. It is not a magazine subscription. You don't have to renew it.
Craig Ferguson,"Celebrity couples renew their wedding vows all the time. They usually give an interview explaining their marriage is ""rock solid,"" and they just want to ""get back to what's important."" And the husband is ""totally not gay."""
David Letterman,The United States is going to make a deal with Russia and Syria. What could possibly go wrong? Here’s the deal: Syria will turn over their stockpiled chemicals and we send them Alex Rodriguez.
Jimmy Fallon,"Since marijuana is now legal in Colorado they have to tax it like anything else, and this got people upset. This week, activists in Colorado were handing out free marijuana to protest the high taxes. Then later the pot activists were like, “We did WHAT?” "
Jimmy Fallon,"There's been some talk that the Vatican is considering a new rule that would allow Catholic priests to get married one day. Critics of the rule say priests should remain celibate. While others said, “You've never been married, have you?”"
Jimmy Fallon,"HBO announced a new detective show starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Apparently they try to break suspects using that new interrogation technique, ""laid-back cop/even more laid-back cop."" "
Jimmy Fallon,"One Direction's new concert movie apparently has flopped at the U.K. box office even though it's been a huge hit here in the U.S. Yeah, they're killing it here, and doing terrible over in England — or as toothpaste put it, “Join the club.” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"In New York, former Congressman Anthony Weiner became the first candidate to concede in his bid to become the Democratic candidate for mayor. Weiner got less than 5 percent of the vote and came in fifth. There's got to be something else he can run for. I have 3,000 more Anthony Weiner jokes."
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know, while losing the election was bad news for Anthony Weiner, it was great news for Carlos Danger. Carlos just opened four new dating accounts."
