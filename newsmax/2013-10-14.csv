David Letterman,How many of you are only here because you had trouble signing up for Obamacare?
Jimmy Kimmel,Today was day 14 of the government shutdown. I am starting to forget what it is like to have a government. There was a guy with big ears and a suit who talked about hope. That is all gone. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Just when you think that Congress could not do anything less, they manage to. At this point the government is like a house on Halloween that turns out the lights and leaves a bowl of candy on the front porch."
Jimmy Kimmel,On Thursday the Bears beat the Giants. Usually the Giants lose on Sundays but they wanted to get it in early this week so they could enjoy the weekend.
Craig Ferguson,It is yet another bad day for the American government. It's still shut down â€” Shut down like the New York Giants.
Craig Ferguson,I can't believe it's Columbus day already. I haven't even taken down my Arbor Day decorations.
