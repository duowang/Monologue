Jimmy Kimmel,There are new reports that the NSA has been monitoring communications of 35 leaders. Germany's Angela Merkel is one of our closest allies and she is not happy about this. She called President Obama to give him an earful — and it takes a lot to get those ears full. 
Jimmy Kimmel,If the NSA agents are like most men they were probably only pretending to listen to what she was saying anyway.
Jimmy Kimmel,They ought to take all of the guys who are so good at hacking into phone calls and put them to work fixing HealthCare.gov. We need to reallocate our nerds.

Jimmy Fallon,One poll says 74 percent of Americans will hand out candy to trick-or-treaters. While the other 26 percent plan to spend three hours hiding in the living room with the lights out.

Craig Ferguson,"Two American icons celebrate birthdays today. The Statue of Liberty turns 127 years old. And Bruce Jenner, who of course is also 127 years old. "
