Conan O'Brian,"We are posting online many of our rare or never-before-seen clips from the show's past 20 years. You can see them online but if you really want a laugh, go to HealthCare.gov. That's where the good chuckles are. "
Conan O'Brian,"It has been 20 years on the air and everyone in my family is very emotional. My dad called me this morning and he told me something he has never said to me before. He said, ""Son, we don't have cable TV."" I wept for an hour."
Jay Leno,"Just when you thought the state of American healthcare couldn't get any worse, Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael Jackson's doctor, has been released from jail. "
Jay Leno,For years President Obama has been saying that no one would lose their healthcare plan. Now the White House has admitted that in fact many people will lose their plans. But there is a way to keep the great coverage you have. Just become a member of Congress. Then the taxpayers pay for the whole thing.
Jay Leno,There was some good news today for embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Obamacare will cover all her injuries after the White House throws her under the bus. She is totally covered. 
Jay Leno,"Have you tried to get on the Obamacare website? Oh, it is slow! It is so slow that by the time you sign up for Obamacare you’ll be eligible for Medicare. It's slower than a ticket scalper at a Jacksonville Jaguars game. "
Craig Ferguson,"Bob Barker will appear on ""The Price Is Right"" to mark his 90th birthday. Bob said he'll do something he should have been done long ago — spay and neuter Drew Carey."

Craig Ferguson,"Obama is also being criticized for the Obamacare website. You know what's wrong with that website? A lot of the people trying to sign up for Obamacare are elderly. So you've already lost them at ""website."""
Craig Ferguson,The Jonas Brothers have broken up. The music industry is in mourning. It's kind of like when the Beatles announced they were breaking up — minus the part where people gave a crap. 
David Letterman,"Guess who's out of prison? Dr. Conrad Murray. He was sentenced to four years in prison, and he served only two years. But he had to serve his time in the prison waiting room. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Krispy Kreme says it will give a free doughnut to any customer who shows up wearing a costume on Halloween. So if you're the kind of person willing to take the time to dress up in a costume just to get a free doughnut, then yes, you've hit rock bottom. "
Jimmy Fallon,A new study found that eating pasta can actually cause depression. Though not as much as that other thing — dressing up like Batman to get a free doughnut.
Jimmy Fallon,Americans are expected to spend more than $2 billion on Halloween candy this year. And those Americans are Honey Boo Boo and Mama June.  
Jimmy Fallon,"A blooper reel from the original ""Star Wars"" movies was leaked online this week. That's right — a series of embarrassing ""Star Wars"" mistakes caught on film. Or as fans call that: the last three ""Star Wars"" movies."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Red Sox are up 3-2 in the World Series with the last two games at home in Boston. Cardinals fans are not feeling good, but it ain't over until the lady who is actually a healthy weight but made to feel fat adhering to impossible standards set by advertisers sings. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"As baseball wraps up, a new NBA season tips off. It's the special time when we have baseball, football, and basketball at the same time — the holy trinity of ignoring our families. "
