David Letterman,Did everybody have a good Halloween? I'm just not into the Halloween spirit. What I did was I went to bed early after I turned on the electric fence. 
Jay Leno,Did you all have a fun Halloween? One little kid came to my door dressed as Justin Bieber. Then I realized that it WAS Justin Bieber.
Jay Leno,"Six kids showed up for Halloween with no costumes at all, just dressed like ordinary people. They said, ""We're the six people who signed up for Obamacare on the first day."""
Jay Leno,"According to CBS News, only six people enrolled in Obamacare on the first day of the rollout. Six! That means more people have walked on the moon than have signed up for Obamacare. "
Jay Leno,"This is my favorite part. Hand to God, this is the absolute truth. The White House said that the number six is not official. Really, aren't they better off saying nothing? Not official? What, if we wait it could go as high as seven?"
Jimmy Fallon,"This weekend is the end of daylight saving time. Or, put another way, your microwave is about to have the right time on it again. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night the Obamas gave out dried fruit to more than 5,000 trick-or-treaters. In a related story, today workers outside the White House had to sweep up a bunch of dried fruit."
Jimmy Fallon,That same study also found that fruit has become the second most popular food in the U.S. The first most popular food in the U.S.? NOT fruit.
Jimmy Fallon,"There are reports that a spin-off of “How I Met Your Mother” is in the works called ""How I Met Your Father."" I think I’ve seen that show already. It’s called “Maury.”"
Craig Ferguson,"Today is World Vegan Day. It’s the day we're all supposed to think about a vegan diet . . . There, I thought about it. It's not for me."
Craig Ferguson,"Vegans can't eat eggs. They can't eat dairy. From what I've seen, they can't even shave their legs."
Craig Ferguson,"Ozzy Osbourne recently started a vegan diet. Right now up in animal heaven, there's a bat without a head saying, ""Oh, so now he's vegan."""
Craig Ferguson,"Mike Tyson is a vegan. Apparently, vegans can't eat meat or dairy, but it's OK to occasionally nibble on Evander Holyfield's ear."
