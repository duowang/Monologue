Craig Ferguson,"The great David Bowie turned 66 today. To celebrate, he released a new music video. I wish I could be like David Bowie and just disappear, stay under the radar and out of the spotlight for 10 years. Well, I've been doing this show for eight years, so just another two to go. "
Craig Ferguson,David Bowie is fantastic. I like to think I have some things in common with him. He's from Britain. I'm from Britain. He used to have a problem with cocaine. I used to have a problem with cocaine. He's considered a genius. I used to have a problem with cocaine.
Craig Ferguson,"I started listening to Bowie back in the 1970s. A big part of his mystique back then was his sexuality. He was ambiguous. Bowie made androgyny cool. In the decade before Bowie, music was dominated by macho, manly men. Like Elvis, Frank Sinatra, and Liberace.

Jimmy Kimmel,"My New Year's resolution this year was to get a gym membership, use it twice, and then never use it again. I'm already halfway there."
