David Letterman,"Are you thrilled about Super Bowl XLVII? Are you ready to go? The 50-yard line is where you'd want to sit, right? From there you are so close you can smell the deer antler spray."
Jimmy Kimmel,On Sunday the 49ers take on the Ravens in Super Bowl. Here's what I don't get. They spend a lot of money on the commercials. Shouldn't they run the beer and chip commercials BEFORE the Super Bowl? 
Jimmy Kimmel,I have a lot of eating planned for Sunday. Hot wings. Nachos. Sausages. The inside of my stomach is going to look like a Michelle Obama nightmare.
Jimmy Kimmel,"There's a petition going around asking President Obama to make the day after the Super Bowl a national holiday. That's a good idea. After a long, exhausting day of sitting on the couch watching TV, I need a day off. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"The petition has almost 12,000 signatures. Do we need a day off after the Super Bowl? Isn't that kind of disrespectful to our real holidays?"
Jay Leno,"Former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino has admitted he fathered a child while having an extramarital affair with a CBS production assistant. And today Manti Te'o said, ""See, that's why you have imaginary girlfriends."""
Jay Leno,"Today Dr. Phil spoke to the guy who was behind the Manti Te'o hoax in a special two-part episode of ""Dr. Phil."" That's when you know somebody's really screwed up — when Dr. Phil needs two shows to fix him."
Jay Leno,"Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis once again denied using the banned substance deer antler velvet extract. He says these accusations are nothing more than a trick of the devil. Today Patriots coach Bill Belichick said, ""Why am I getting dragged into this? I had nothing to do with it."""
Jay Leno,"In his farewell speech to the Senate this week, John Kerry spoke for 51 minutes about Washington being gridlocked. The cause of the gridlock? Senators giving 51-minute speeches."
Jimmy Fallon,Former NFL quarterback Dan Marino has admitted to fathering a secret child back in 2005. I don't know why people are surprised — the Dolphins never gave him good protection.
Jimmy Fallon,"To compete with the Super Bowl on Sunday, TNT is airing a marathon of “Law & Order.” Now viewers have two places to see Ray Lewis."
Jimmy Fallon,"Lance Armstrong has turned down a spot on the new season of “Dancing With the Stars.” Even weirder, Manti Te'o's girlfriend said yes."
Jimmy Fallon,"A bipartisan group of senators has unveiled a plan that would create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Or as immigrants call that, ""a tunnel."""
Craig Ferguson,"Today is the anniversary of the very first daytime soap opera. It was called ""These Are My Children,"" and it premiered in 1949 on NBC. There aren't many soap operas left. They're going away, like newspapers and compact discs and Lance Armstrong fans."
Craig Ferguson,"With Facebook, now you can watch any person's life like it's a soap opera, assuming it's a real person. Am I right, college football players with fake girlfriends?"
Craig Ferguson,"Growing up in Scotland, I watched the soap opera ""Coronation Street."" It was on TV over there for 50 years — like Larry King in this country."
