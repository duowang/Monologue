Craig Ferguson,"There's a big movie out today. It's called ""The Last Exorcism Part 2."" How can it be called ""The Last Exorcism Part 2""? By definition, a movie called ""last anything"" can't have a sequel. It's not possible. Unless â€” unless Hollywood is run by profit-hungry liars."
Craig Ferguson,"In the first ""Last Exorcist,"" a young girl gets possessed by Satan. The priest performs an exorcism to try and cast him out. I guess in part two, the devil returns because he forgot his wallet or something."
Craig Ferguson,"Some people think I got this show because I made a deal with the devil. It's true, actually. Nine years ago, the devil promised me great fame and untold wealth in exchange for my soul. But I broke the deal. Now I'm condemned to this place for all eternity."
Craig Ferguson,"If you're scheduling an exorcism, you need to make sure someone's actually possessed. If a young woman looks sickly and pale and vomits all the time, she may just be an actress."
