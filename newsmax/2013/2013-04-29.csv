Jay Leno,Washington Wizards center Jason Collins has become the first American athlete in a major team sport to come out as gay. Do you know what a breakthrough this is? Finally an NBA player who won’t have any illegitimate kids.
Jay Leno,Collins said it was not a tough decision to tell people that he’s gay. He said it’s easier than telling people he plays for the Washington Wizards. That’s the hard part. 
Jay Leno,"I had a birthday over the weekend. I turned 63. That is an awkward age. It’s too old for NBC, but it’s still too young to play for the Lakers. "
Jay Leno,"According to a new study, fatty foods can boost your memory. Eating junk food can make your memory better. There was a similar study done five years ago. It was April 17, 2008, at 2 p.m. on a Wednesday. I remember it was drizzling. I had a dark suit with a yellow tie. I remember it like it was yesterday."
Craig Ferguson,"Jason Collins is the first athlete in a major U.S. sport to announce he's gay. He's a free-agent now, but his last team was the Washington Wizards. He's not the first openly gay wizard. That trail was blazed by Dumbledore. "
Craig Ferguson,So far the reaction from fans and teammates has been nothing but positive. Why shouldn't it be? Jason Collins has nothing to be ashamed of. It's not like he plays for the Lakers.
Craig Ferguson,The positive reaction to Jason’s announcement is a great sign. It shows us that NBA fans are ready to embrace diversity. And they really want to concentrate on what unites them — hating the Miami Heat.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Jason Collins became the first active athlete from a major American sport to come out of the closet. He wrote an article in Sports Illustrated. He said, “I'm a 34-year-old NBA center, I'm black, and I'm gay. For those who don't follow sports, this is like a contestant on “Project Runway” coming out as straight. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Here's a disturbing bit of progress. Microsoft is allowing video gamers to order pizza directly from their Xbox. Previously they had to yell for their mom to make them a sandwich. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Thanks to the new pizza app, you can place an order using your controller. Please don't tell Michelle Obama about this. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Xbox will not stop until humans and couches become one.
