Jay Leno,"President Obama is in Mexico. He'll be on hand to celebrate Mexico's economic successes over the last few years. See, that’s how it works now. If President Obama wants to celebrate an economic success, he actually has to leave the country."
Jay Leno,"While in Mexico, President Obama plans to promote his immigration policy. Is that really necessary? Seems the last place you have to promote immigration is Mexico. I think they've got it down. That's like going to San Francisco to promote gay marriage."

Craig Ferguson,A new study finally explains what's wrong with young people. Researchers have proven that young people are greedy and more materialistic. The study is in something called a newspaper. It's like a blog. But everything in it is from yesterday.
Craig Ferguson,The study refers to young people as millennials. It says they perform poorly in job interviews. There's nothing worse than a bad interview — realizing a person sitting across from you has checked out and just doesn't care. Ask any of my guests on this show. They'll tell you. It's a terrible experience.
Craig Ferguson,"I get annoyed when people do studies like this. They break society into different groups. Then they assign everyone in the group with the same set of characteristics. I can't stand that kind of small-minded thinking. Then again, I'm a Taurus. We're all like that."
Craig Ferguson,"I don't consider myself a baby boomer. To me, that means hippies. What do I have in common with a hippie? I never went to Woodstock. I never wore flowers in my hair. I never took huge amounts of LSD and then battled killer ducks who I swear were out to kill me. All right, I did the last one but I didn't think it was groovy."
