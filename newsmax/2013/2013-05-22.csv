Craig Ferguson,"On this day in 1859, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. He's the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Arthur Conan Doyle was a man of many talents. He was a writer and a doctor. If he were around today, he would be a frequent guest on ""Oprah."""

The one that passed was a proposition that limits the number of marijuana dispensaries in the city. The rule now is there cannot be more marijuana stores than cupcake shops — because they feed on each other.
