Craig Ferguson,"Over Memorial Day weekend, ""Fast & Furious 6"" made a patrillion dollars. The star of these movies is Vin Diesel. In the new movie, Vin and his crew come out of retirement for ""one last job."" Which, if I'm not mistaken, is what they did in the last two movies. And probably the next two as well. "
Craig Ferguson,"""Fast & Furious 6"" also stars Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Between The Rock and Vin Diesel, you know the dialogue will be sensational."
Craig Ferguson,"The producers said today they are going to start filming ""Fast & Furious 7"" only when the script is just right. No, that is a joke. Come on! They filmed it already. They did it on an iPhone over the weekend."
Craig Ferguson,I wonder who'll play the bad guy in part 7? I think Jason Statham. He is the perfect tough guy. He's so tough he can beat you up with his thoughts. 
Craig Ferguson,"Jason Statham just looks at you, and you're toast. In fact, that's how Jason Statham makes toast."
