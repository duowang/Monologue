Craig Ferguson,"There's a new movie out today. It doesn't have superheroes or spaceships or Vin Diesels, which means that no one will go see it. "
Craig Ferguson,"The new movie is called ""Now You See Me,"" and it's about everyone's favorite subject, magic. That is a phrase often used by magicians. Along with ""hocus pocus"" and ""abracadabra"" and ""hey, why is everyone leaving?"""
Craig Ferguson,"It's not that difficult to be a magician. All you need is a cape, a top hat, and a willingness to sell your soul to Satan in exchange for mystical powers. "
Craig Ferguson,"And by ""mystical powers,"" I mean an endless stream of colorful handkerchiefs."
Craig Ferguson,"Magic's changed over the years. I used to like the old-school magicians. I don't like the modern-day magicians who just do really lame stunts. David Blaine says ""I'm going to hold my breath for 17 days."" That's not magic, that's a cure for hiccups."
