David Letterman,During the summer all scandals will be reruns. That's a programming reminder from the White House.
Jay Leno,"The Vatican has confirmed a second miracle by the late Pope John Paul II, clearing the way for him to become a saint. Under church law you have to perform two miracles to become a saint. That seems a little strict, doesn't it? You perform a miracle — a miracle! And they say, ""What else you got?"""
Jay Leno,"The daughter of baseball great Joe Torre, Christina Torre, is being called a hero today after she caught a baby that fell out of a two-story window in New York City. And not only that, but later she went over to Wall Street and caught a couple of stockbrokers that had just jumped out the window."
Jay Leno,"Bad day on Wall Street — the stock market dropped over 350 points today. See, I knew Obama shouldn’t have come back home. I knew this was going to happen."
Jay Leno,"Yesterday the FBI admitted they do use drones on U.S. soil for domestic surveillance. The FBI's Robert Mueller told Congress that he does sometimes use drones, but he said the good news is that these drones are made in America, by Americans, to spy on Americans."
Jimmy Fallon,Last night the White House staff played softball against a team made of marijuana lobbyists. Which explains why there were 20 hits before the game even started.
Jimmy Fallon,The on-deck circle was a drum circle. 
Jimmy Fallon,Fashion designers Dolce & Gabbana have been sentenced to 20 months in jail for tax evasion. Their lawyers are appealing the sentence while Dolce & Gabbana are appealing the prison uniform. Orange is so last year.
Jimmy Fallon,"That's right. Dolce & Gabbana were convicted of tax evasion. It didn't help when the judge asked how they pled, and they were like ""Fabulous?"""
Craig Ferguson,Clothing designers Dolce & Gabbana are in a lot of trouble. They have been found guilty of tax evasion. They probably won't do any jail time. Which is a relief because stripes are out this year. 
Craig Ferguson,The judge ordered Dolce & Gabbana to pay a huge fine. It could be high as $13 million. That's chump change for Dolce & Gabbana. Those guys giving up $13 million would be like Jay Leno giving up one car.
Craig Ferguson,It would be like Lance Armstrong giving up one syringe.
Craig Ferguson,"Apparently, Dolce & Gabbana were an item for 23 years. They broke up in 2005 but still work together. That's got to be tough, working with an ex. I go through it every time Drew Carey's on this show."
