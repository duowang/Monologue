David Letterman,"I'm Dave Letterman, or as the staff likes to call me, ""the royal baby."" "
Conan O'Brian,"The royal baby was born today. But don't worry, America, we still have Honey Boo Boo."

Conan O'Brian,"Kate Middleton had her baby. The royal baby is eight pounds. Then again, you can't really put a price on a child.
"

Jay Leno,"I’m sure you all heard the news about the royal baby. William and Kate are the proud parents of a baby boy. Can you believe the media coverage? You’d think it was Kim Kardashian and Kanye West having a kid. 




"
Jay Leno,"They kept saying on the news, ""the royal couple welcomes a baby boy."" Well, I hope so. Do people sometimes give a kid the cold shoulder? "
Jay Leno,I understand there’s a lot of celebrating going on at Buckingham Palace right now. I just hope they’re able to get up for work tomorrow.
Jay Leno,"Detroit has become the largest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy. What happened was Detroit's population dropped something like 70 percent, but the government got bigger. The tax base got smaller, but the government got bigger. Thank God that kind of thing could never happen in Washington."
Jimmy Fallon,"It finally happened. Kate Middleton gave birth to a baby boy today. The baby weighed about eight pounds. Americans were like, ""How much is that in dollars?"""
Jimmy Fallon,"Kate Middleton went into labor this morning in London. When the rest of the royal family heard, they were like, ""Oh my God. What's labor?"""
Jimmy Fallon,"We have former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer on the show tonight. He'll be here only for about five minutes, but we're charging him for the full hour. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Eliot Spitzer is on the show. When he got here, I said, “Do you need someone to escort, er, show you to your dressing room?"" "
Craig Ferguson,It's a great day for our friends in the U.K. There's a new royal baby. The royal family is delighted. Prince Harry popped some champagne and danced naked around the palace. Then he heard about the baby. 
Craig Ferguson,"The prince said what any proud family member would say: ""Back of the line, junior."""
Craig Ferguson,"There were very few people in the room for the birth. Prince William, the father, was there. Kate Middleton's mother was there, and Neil Patrick Harris — I believe he was there. He does the Emmys, the Tonys, the royal birth. And you know what, he makes it better. Normally I don't enjoy these things but when Neil does it, it's entertaining."
