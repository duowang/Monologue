Jimmy Kimmel,The University of Iowa has been named the No. 1 party school in America for 2013. So congratulations and shame on them. 
Jimmy Kimmel,One thing nice about Iowa: It is flat. So when you pass out you won't fall off any cliffs or anything. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"An Iowa spokesman said the percentage of kids drinking five or more drinks in a day dropped from 73 percent in 2009 to only 58 percent last year. I like that they say ""only 58 percent."" That is when you know you have a party school on your hands. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"I don't know why the Iowa school would deny something like that. If I was in charge, not only would I not deny it, I would mention it in all the advertising."
Jay Leno,"U.S. embassies are closed all around the Middle East this week due to a terrorist threat. What happened was the U.S. intercepted a conference call of 20 al-Qaida operatives. Twenty on one conference call! Who is their carrier? I go under a bridge and my cellphone drops the call, but they can get 20 people in one call from a cave?"
Jay Leno,"We had President Obama on the show last night. It was a huge honor, but all the security made it difficult getting into the building. Security was checking IDs, the Secret Service was searching cars, Donald Trump was out front checking birth certificates — it was crazy."
Jay Leno,"The Republican National Committee now says if NBC and CNN don't pull plans for a Hillary Clinton miniseries and movie, they won't hold any Republican debates on those networks. That works for me! Now if we could just get the Democrats to pull their debates, we wouldn’t have to watch any of that crap."

Craig Ferguson,"I'm not one of those ex-smokers who says, ""I'll never smoke again."" I would start smoking again in a heartbeat. The only thing stopping me is the painful early death."
Craig Ferguson,"I fancy smoking a pipe. Actually, I would like to just fill my pipe and then put on a robe and go around solving crimes."
Craig Ferguson,"The big trend these days is electronic cigarettes. They are not as bad for you. I suppose they're safer than regular cigarettes, but a lot of things are safer than cigarettes. That's like saying your movie made more money than ""The Lone Ranger"" or like saying you fathered fewer children than Arnold Schwarzenegger."
