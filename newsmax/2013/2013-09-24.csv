Craig Ferguson,"Bill Clinton gave the keynote address today at the Clinton Global Initiative, the charity he started in 2005. Sometimes when presidents retire, they take it easy. But they quickly realize that if you're not the president, nobody cares about you or anything you have to say. It is a condition also known as ""being vice president."""
Craig Ferguson,Being president is one of the most stressful jobs in the world. It's right up there with being Paula Deen's publicist.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Tonight on ABC is the premiere of ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" It's the most highly anticipated show ever with six periods."
Jimmy Kimmel,"S.H.I.E.L.D. is a secret government agency that helps The Avengers fight crime, so the show is not about superheroes. It's essentially a show about the administrative assistants to superheroes."
