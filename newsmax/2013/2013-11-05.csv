Jay Leno,"There's now growing concern in Iran about the health of 74-year-old Ayatollah Khamenei, the country's supreme leader. He has a chronic illness. You think healthcare is bad in this country, try seeing a doctor under Ayatollah-Care. See how that works."
Jay Leno,"NSA whistle-blower and traitor Edward Snowden, living in asylum in Russia, has released a manifesto directed at the United States claiming that telling the truth should not be a crime.

Craig Ferguson,"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford fessed up to smoking crack. He said he smoked the crack when he was in ""a drunken stupor."" Is that a defense? That doesn't absolve you of your behavior.
