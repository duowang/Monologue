Conan O'Brian,You know that smiling woman who was featured on the home page of Healthcare.gov? She asked for her picture to be removed after she was cyber-bullied. She's hiding where nobody can see her — at Healthcare.gov.

Jay Leno,The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won their first game of the season the other night. They beat the Miami Dolphins 22-19. This was an important loss for the Dolphins because they proved they can embarrass themselves without Richie Incognito.

Jay Leno,"On Monday, President Obama paid tribute to America's oldest living veteran, 107-year-old Richard Overton. Overton credits his longevity to drinking whiskey and smoking 12 cigars every day. Now there's a health plan we can all get behind."

Jay Leno,"
Craig Ferguson,"It's Sadie Hawkins Day. It is the day a woman can ask a man out for a date or a dance. I think women can now do that any day they like, but today's the day they can do it without the guilt and passive aggression. "
Craig Ferguson,Don't confuse Sadie Hawkins Day with Stephen Hawkins Day. That is when girls are allowed to ask guys about the basic principles of theoretical physics.
David Letterman,New York City is in a drought crisis. We haven't had rain since Labor Day. It's killing the rhubarb.  
Jimmy Fallon,"It seems like everyone’s still pretty upset about this Obamacare website. The Department of Health and Human Services emailed 275,000 Americans, encouraging them to give the Obamacare website another try. Then they said “But one at a time, so it doesn't crash again.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"It turns out that a lot of children could lose their dental insurance under Obamacare. So kids might not be able to go to the dentist. Parents were really upset, while kids said, “Four more years! Four more years!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"I don’t know what’s happening with ""Dancing With the Stars"" this year, but people just aren’t watching as much as they used to. They’re trying to think of anything they can to boost ratings. In fact, I heard they might even try adding celebrities to the show. "
Jimmy Fallon,"It was just announced that “All My Children” has been canceled after it was moved online. Apparently, they forgot to consider one problem with that idea: Nobody's grandma knows how to go online. "

Jimmy Kimmel,"The idea of a birthday cake is great when you think about it. Your friends and family gather around. It's like, ""Oh, no, a cake is on fire. If someone doesn't put it out, we will all die."" Then you step forward and say, ""I've got this."" You blow the fire out and everyone applauds. It's like being Superman — a very out-of-shape version of Superman."
Jimmy Kimmel,We have music tonight from The Killers. It's our second night with them. They were here last night too. I guess that makes them Serial Killers.
Jimmy Kimmel,Toronto Mayor Rob Ford admitted last week to having smoked crack while in office. Since then he has said multiple times that he will not step down. Legally they can't force him to. The city council held a meeting to vote on whether or not to ask him to resign. That seems very Canadian to me.
