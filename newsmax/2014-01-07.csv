Craig Ferguson,"Health experts are calling 2014 ""the year of the flu."" I think it needs a better name."
Craig Ferguson,"Apparently, the dominant strain of the flu this year is the swine flu. "
Craig Ferguson,"I thought the swine flu was history. But just when we thought it left us, now it has come back to make people sick and wreak more havoc. It's like Dennis Rodman. "
Craig Ferguson,Dennis Rodman and the North Koreans — is this an episode of “Scooby-Doo”?
David Letterman,It's 8 degrees today. Tomorrow's going to be 28 degrees. Thank God I didn't put away my tank top.
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s so cold that doctors are telling people to avoid drinking alcohol if they go outside because it can lead to frostbite. Then parents who've been stuck inside with their kids for three days were like, “It's worth the risk.”"

Jimmy Kimmel,"Dennis Rodman took six former NBA players to North Korea to play against a local team in celebration of Kim Jong Un's 31st birthday. I guess after years of playing alongside Michael Jordan, Rodman is very comfortable with totalitarian dictators.  "
Jimmy Kimmel,Dennis Rodman is like the uncle that Kim Jong Un never had killed.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Rodman is getting a lot of criticism for palling around with an enemy of the U.S., but he says it's a great idea for the world. And this is a guy who starred in the movie ""Double Team"" with Jean-Claude Van Damme so he knows when there's a great idea for the world. "
