David Letterman,It's warming up a little bit here in the northeast. The polar vortex has departed. It was supposed to leave Monday night but it got stuck on the George Washington Bridge.
Conan O'Brian,"It's getting warmer. The polar vortex that put the country into a deep freeze is now headed up north to Canada. Finally, payback for giving us Justin Bieber."
Conan O'Brian,Everyone is fine but Honey Boo Boo's family was involved in a minor traffic accident. Apparently their home rear-ended their neighbor's home.
Conan O'Brian,McDonald's restaurants in Japan have started selling cheese fries that you can't get here in the United States. That makes me wonder: Who really won World War II?
Conan O'Brian,The government is accusing the makers of several weight loss products of deceiving the public. Probably the most deceptive of these companies — Cinnabon.
Jay Leno,New Jersey Governor Chris Christie doesn't know yet if he's running for president in 2016. I guess he'll cross that bridge when he comes to it.
Jay Leno,"Somebody at Governor Christie's office was involved in a traffic lane closure at the George Washington Bridge. It clogged up a major artery, causing a huge traffic jam. But Christie is denying any personal involvement. He said he was too busy clogging his own arteries at the time."
Jay Leno,"Pundits are saying this could hurt his 2016 presidential campaign. The ironic thing is this: Now that Christie is denying everything he sounds even more presidential, doesn’t he? "
Jay Leno,"After his denial, Christie quickly left the news conference to deal with a more personal crisis: the Velveeta cheese shortage."
Jay Leno,"In the new movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" they say the F-word was used a record 506 times. Thus breaking the old record of 505 times set by President Obama when he heard about Robert Gates’ new book."
Jimmy Fallon,Chris Christie is dealing with a scandal after it was revealed that a top aide shut down access to the George Washington Bridge to get back at a mayor for not endorsing him. Christie was furious when they blocked the bridge. He thought they said they were blocking the FRIDGE. 
Jimmy Fallon,Chris Christie held a press conference today to address the bridge scandal. He insisted that he is not a bully — and he will sit on anyone who says otherwise. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday, President Obama gave photographers a rare chance to take pictures of his weekly lunch with Joe Biden. Then Biden told his friends, ""Told you I knew the president."""
Jimmy Fallon,"A new study found that babies as young as nine months can tell the difference between friends and enemies. Which raises a lot of questions, like: What kind of babies have enemies?"
Jimmy Kimmel,The polar vortex that's terrorized much of the United States and Canada this week is just about gone. I'm kind of disappointed in the polar vortex. It's a pretty unsuccessful vortex if not a single person gets pulled into a different dimension. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Chris Christie is embroiled in a scandal involving lane closures near the George Washington Bridge. The scandal could damage Christie's chances of getting nominated for president in 2016, but he'll probably bounce back. He seems like a pretty bouncy person."
Jimmy Kimmel,Iran is encouraging families to have more children to boost the population. They have a plan to give a gold coin to any family that has a baby. Maybe we should send Dennis Rodman and his squad of former NBA players straight from North Korea over there. They'll get that birthrate up in no time.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Right now Iran's population is around 80 million. Their supreme leader wants to get it up to 150 million. If he wants more pregnancies, he should start by legalizing alcohol over there."
