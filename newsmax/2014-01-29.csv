Jay Leno,"The president said that unemployment is dropping, but critics claim it doesn't include people who have left the workforce. How about people who were asked to leave the workforce like me? Are we included in that? "

Jimmy Kimmel,"By the way, when you have Justin Bieber and Rob Ford in the same place, it's like Gotham City getting attacked by the Joker and the Penguin at once."
