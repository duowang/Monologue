David Letterman,"Sunday is Groundhog Day, coincidentally with Super Bowl Sunday. I'm very excited. I get up early on Groundhog Day. I stuff the groundhog and I put it in a medium oven, and I'm ready to go."
Jay Leno,You want to be careful if you gamble on the Super Bowl. Last year I made a Super Bowl bet with Jimmy Fallon. I think we know how that turned out. 
Jay Leno,"In Atlanta, people are still complaining about the slow response to the icy roads and snow. I don’t think the governor helped himself. His excuse was, ""Emergency crews would have been there sooner, but there was a storm."" "
Jay Leno,It is still cold all across the nation. It was so cold today that Al Gore called global warming a hoax.
Jay Leno,"Ratings for President Obama's State of the Union address were the lowest in 14 years. The speech drew 33 million people, which is still pretty good — considering it was a rerun."
Jimmy Fallon,A zoo in Utah says that its ape named Eli has chosen the Seahawks to win the Super Bowl. Which means Peyton Manning now has TWO Elis quietly rooting against him.
Jimmy Fallon,The NFL announced that veteran referee Terry McAulay will lead the referee crew at Sunday’s Super Bowl. So if you had him in your referee pool . . . please contact Gambler’s Anonymous. You have a problem.
Jimmy Fallon,"House Republicans unveiled a new plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become citizens if they learn about American history. Which will be great, because then they can teach it to Americans."
Craig Ferguson,"Sunday is the Super Bowl. As I like to call it, ""the Oscars for straight people."""
Craig Ferguson,I like the Broncos' logo. It is aggressive. There is nothing like a severed horse head to show the opponent you mean business. 
Craig Ferguson,"It is amazing that both Peyton Manning, Broncos quarterback, and younger brother Eli Manning grew up to be NFL quarterbacks like their dad. I have two sons. If they someday both end up hosting late-night talk shows, that will make me unbelievably sad. "
Craig Ferguson,It is the Broncos vs. the Seahawks. That raises an interesting question. What is a Seahawk? A hawk that somehow learned to swim? Or a mutant fish that has grown wings?
