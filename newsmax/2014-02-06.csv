David Letterman,"Tomorrow night the Olympics begin from Sochi. A lot of people over there say the hotels stink. The problem is there are only three hotels in Sochi. Of course, you have the Ritz Chernobyl. You have the Sheraton Gulag. And really the best one over there, The Two Seasons."
Conan O'Brian,The Olympics start airing tonight on NBC. It's a big deal. NBC will finally get to show somebody who is OK with passing the torch.
Conan O'Brian,"There are 12 new events in this year's Winter Olympics, 12. The new events include women's ski jumping, luge-team relay, and finding a working toilet."
Conan O'Brian,"We're very excited to have the cast of ""The Walking Dead"" tonight. Normally, if you want to see the walking dead in L.A., you have to go to the mall of Tarzana."
Jay Leno,"I don’t like goodbyes. NBC does. Well, tonight is our last show for real. See, I don’t need to get fired three times. I get the hint. 
"
Jay Leno,"You know, being together all these years, the staff is very close. It's kind of like graduating high school — a high school for really stupid people that have been in the same class for 22 years. "
Jay Leno,"And the worst thing about losing this job, I'm no longer covered by NBC. I have to sign up for Obamacare."
Jay Leno,"When I started hosting, Justin Bieber wasn’t even born yet. That's why we call those “the good old days."" "
Jay Leno,"It was revealed this week that in the past couple years Hugh Grant has fathered three children with two different women. How ironic is that? I end my run the same way it began — asking Hugh Grant, ""What the hell were you thinking?"" Twenty-two years later, I ask him the same question."
Jimmy Fallon,"The Olympic torch arrived in Sochi yesterday, after going on a four-month relay around the world. That's when you know things are bad — when even the TORCH is putting off going to Russia."
Jimmy Fallon,"I guess it isn’t going well over there. In fact, I heard there’s even a shortage of pillows. The shortage is so bad that visitors are being asked to give their pillows to the Olympic athletes, because there's nothing more comforting than waking up in Russia to see a stranger coming at you with a pillow. ""How was your sleep, Mr. Bond?"""
Jimmy Fallon,"After facing backlash from customers, Subway says it will remove a chemical in its bread that’s also found in yoga mats. Some people were like, “You mean I’ve been eating a dangerous chemical?” While most people were like, “You mean I can eat my yoga mat?”"
Jimmy Fallon,"It was also weird when bread came in regular, whole wheat, and Lululemon. "
Craig Ferguson,"This is the last night Jay Leno is hosting ""The Tonight Show."" Good luck, Jay. The lesson here is if you work hard and succeed, someday you will be fired."
Craig Ferguson,That's why I'm happy right here. They can't fire you if they don't know you're on the air. 
Craig Ferguson,"A new LEGO movie is coming out. I've heard some people say, ""This LEGO movie is basically just a two-hour commercial."" These people are completely wrong. It's only 90 minutes."
Craig Ferguson,I think this LEGO movie will do very well. Because people love watching movies that remind them of their childhood. That's why I'll see any movie about binge drinking and scurvy.
