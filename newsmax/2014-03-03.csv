David Letterman,Anybody see the Academy Awards last night? I watch every year to make sure I'm not in the dead actors montage. 
Conan O'Brian,"I'm Conan O'Brien. Or as John Travolta calls me, Kevin O. Zeme."
Conan O'Brian,"In his acceptance speech, Matthew McConaughey said his hero is always himself 10 years from now, so by the time last night's Oscars finished, he was his own hero."
Conan O'Brian,Russia suspended coverage of the Oscars last night. They didn't show it. And I'm going to guess they're not going to show the Tony Awards either. 
Conan O'Brian,Last night was the fourth time Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated for an Oscar and the fourth time he has lost. Being Leonardo DiCaprio must be a living hell. I don't know how he goes on. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tonight we get a visit from the mayor of the great city of Toronto, Rob Ford. I feel like I've been waiting for this night my whole life. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"I have a lot to ask Mayor Ford. I don't think I've had this many questions since the series finale of ""Lost.""  "
Jimmy Kimmel,"When Mayor Ford gets out here, distract him and I'll take his passport. And that way he never leaves us, OK?"
Jimmy Kimmel,Last night the Academy Awards telecast was more than three hours long. They actually had to do a second “In Memoriam” montage because quite a few actors passed away during the broadcast.
Craig Ferguson,I would like to thank you and the Academy and my agent.
Craig Ferguson,The Oscars are finally over. At least I think they're over. 
Craig Ferguson,I stopped watching when they made the joke about Liza Minnelli. I will not stand for that. Liza Minnelli is my spirit animal.
Craig Ferguson,"From what I hear, the stars really let loose at the after-parties. There are rumors in Hollywood right now that Angelina Jolie ate a carb. "
