Jimmy Kimmel,There was a small earthquake here this morning. Scariest thing about an earthquake is that when it starts you have no idea how intense it's going to get or how long it's going to last. It's like when your mother tells you a story.  
Jimmy Kimmel,We had some earthquake damage at my house. Two bottles of lotion fell over and we had to wait two hours for the maid to get there to put them back.  
Jimmy Kimmel,Here's a little-known fact. The Richter scale measures the number of local news anchors who dive under their desks. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yet another video surfaced that showed what appeared to be a drunken Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. When he promised to stop drinking, obviously that didn't include St. Patrick's Day. Or Mardi Gras or Father's Day or Cinco de Mayo. "
Craig Ferguson,I had a big weekend and my throat is very scratchy. I sound the way Irish people are going to sound tomorrow.
Craig Ferguson,"Some American cities go all out for St. Patrick's Day. In Chicago they dye the river green. In Boston everyone wears green. In Colorado, they smoke the green. Then someone tells them it's St. Patrick's Day. "
Craig Ferguson,"Some people say St. Patrick's Day contributes to national stereotypes. Well, I don't want to do that. Take it from me, not everyone in Ireland gets falling-down drunk every day. You're thinking of Australia."
