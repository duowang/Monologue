Jimmy Fallon,"Joe Biden said the U.S. will help Ukraine with financial aid as long as the leaders tackle corruption. Because if anything stops corruption, it's bribing someone to stop corruption. "
Craig Ferguson,"It's the new season of ""Deadliest Catch,"" which kicked off tonight on the Discovery Channel. It's in its 10th season. That's 10 seasons of doing the same repetitive task over and over again. I can't relate to that at all. "
Craig Ferguson,"""Deadliest Catch"" reminds me of this show. They started in 2005. We started in 2005. They have a lot of cursing. We have a lot of cursing. They have multiple Emmy awards. We have lots of cursing."
