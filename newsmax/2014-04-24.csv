David Letterman,"President Obama is visiting Japan, and for dinner last night he had $300 sushi. That's a lot of dough, but you know, it comes with unlimited bread sticks. And Mercury poisoning is covered by Obamacare. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Obama is in Japan today. They showed him a robot developed by Honda that can kick a soccer ball. It's cute watching the president interact with a prototype that will one day enslave us all, isn't it? "
Jimmy Kimmel,"A strange new product is coming to your liver this fall — Palcohol, which is powdered alcohol. It's like Crystal Light that will get you drunk."
Jimmy Kimmel,Palcohol is great for astronauts looking to get wasted in space. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Palcohol flavors include Vodka, rum, mojito, cosmopolitan, and lemon drop. I think Keith Richards will sprinkle this stuff on his Cheerios in the morning."
Seth Meyers,"Today is ""Take Your Child to Work Day."" Or as kids refer to it, ""Play With an iPad in a Corner Day."""
Seth Meyers,"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced plans to build the Barack Obama College Preparatory High School, which will open in 2017. The Obama school is expected to be very popular . . . at first."
Seth Meyers,"McDonald’s has given their clown mascot Ronald McDonald a makeover, trading in his jumpsuit for cropped pants and a blazer. While McDonald’s customers are trading in their sweatpants for bigger sweatpants.  "
Seth Meyers,"Facebook has acquired a new mobile app that would allow users to track their exercise and measure how many calories they’ve burned. So if you love Facebook, and you love exercise, you’re lying about one of those."
Jimmy Fallon,"While he was in Japan today, President Obama visited a science museum, where he played soccer with a robot. Joe Biden is negotiating with the prime minister in Ukraine, and Obama is playing soccer with a robot. It's like the White House version of ""Freaky Friday."" "
Jimmy Fallon,"Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda was ejected last night for having pine tar on his neck, and rubbing it on his hand to get a better grip on the ball — because league rules clearly state that all illegal substances must be put INSIDE your body."
Jimmy Fallon,"Hooters is coming out with a new loyalty program to help frequent customers track their receipts and orders. So if you're someone who goes to Hooters enough to take part in their loyalty program, I'm sorry your wife got the house."
Jimmy Fallon,"Police in Canada were called after a bear got its head stuck in a jar and then walked down the street. Animal control immediately removed the jar and said, “Oh, sorry we didn't recognize you, Mayor Ford.”"
Craig Ferguson,Today the Pentagon announced they are going to spend millions shooting clouds with super-lasers to create more precipitation. It's in The Washington Post newspaper. A newspaper is like a blog except everything is from yesterday. 
Craig Ferguson,Controlling the weather would be great because L.A. is so dry right now. Our rainfall is lower than Obama's approval ratings. It's lower than the Lakers winning percentage. It's lower than CNN's ratings. Lower than Tom Cruise's foot stool. Lower than the box office for that new Johnny Depp movie.
Craig Ferguson,Lasers that control the weather are hard to explain. Basically they hit the cloud and create nitric acid particles that bind water molecules to create condensation nuclei. I hope that clears it up for you.
