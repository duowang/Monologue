David Letterman,This audience's applause is about as convincing as a Donald Sterling apology. 
Jimmy Kimmel,Part two of Donald Sterling's interview with Anderson Cooper aired on CNN tonight. It may have been the first time I've ever seen an apology that was more offensive than the thing being apologized for.
Jimmy Kimmel,"A Massachusetts woman, Brenda Drinkwater, was arrested on a seventh drunk driving charge. ""Drinkwater"" is good advice for her."
Jimmy Kimmel,Yesterday in Bakersfield a 4-year-old was playing in his driveway when a dog comes in and attacks him. Then all of a sudden the family cat charges out and chases the dog off. The boy then gets up and gets out of there. A hero cat. Are you serious?
Seth Meyers,"Last night, Magic Johnson told Anderson Cooper that he’s still waiting for an apology from Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Sterling responded, saying, “I’m very sorry you’re black.”"
Seth Meyers,"According to a new survey, 55 percent of Americans think that they are smarter than the average American. Said the average American, “55 percent? That’s almost half.”"
Seth Meyers,"A Chicago priest is offering a $5,000 reward to help stop gun violence. Meanwhile, people with guns just found out about a priest who has $5,000."
Jimmy Fallon,"A day after Donald Sterling's explosive interview with CNN, Anderson Cooper sat down with Magic Johnson for a follow-up interview. And Magic actually said he's praying for Sterling. Yeah, he’s praying for him to get stuck in an elevator with Beyoncé’s sister."
Jimmy Fallon,"A federal judge ruled yesterday that Idaho's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, so now it’s legal for gay couples to get married. Idaho's gay people all cheered — from their homes in San Francisco and New York. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Happy Birthday to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who turned 30 years old today. It's a big milestone for him because he's now officially the youngest person on Facebook."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday Alec Baldwin got busted for riding his bike the wrong way in a bike lane, and then arguing about it with the cops. He was charged with two counts of “being Alec Baldwin.” "
Craig Ferguson,"George Lucas, the creator of ""Star Wars,"" is 70 years old today. George didn't bother celebrating. He spent the day making unnecessary changes to all his earlier birthdays."
Craig Ferguson,"It's a great day for Transylvania. The 14th century Transylvania castle that inspired the book ""Dracula"" is for sale. Personally, if I wanted a house that belonged to a creepy undead guy, I'd buy the Playboy mansion."
Craig Ferguson,It must be tough for a real estate agent in Transylvania. The castle's a little on the dark side.
