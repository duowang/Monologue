Jimmy Kimmel,"If that firenado isn't the work of Satan, I don't know what is."
Jimmy Kimmel,"That hotel in New York fired the employee who leaked the security camera footage of the fight between Solange Knowles and Jay-Z. But don't feel bad for that person. He's rumored to have been paid $250,000 by TMZ. Let that be a lesson to every low-wage security guard out there. The lesson is to make sure your phone is charged before you come to work."
Seth Meyers,"Last night in the second part of his interview with Anderson Cooper, L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling announced he and his wife are divorcing. Ladies, that means he's going to be single. So run. "

Jimmy Fallon,Last night was part two of the Anderson Cooper interview with Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Sterling said that people think of him as an ogre or Frankenstein. Which isn't true because Frankenstein and ogres are still allowed at NBA games.

Jimmy Fallon,"In an interview, Neil Patrick Harris said he'd never want to do a late-night talk show because he thinks it would be boring doing the same thing every day. And if you want to see more of Neil, you can check him out in that play where he says literally the exact same thing every day."

It's like Oprah caring about clipping coupons. It's like the Lakers caring about winning. It is like the ""Duck Dynasty"" guys caring about Broadway musicals. "
