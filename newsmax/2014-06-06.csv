Jimmy Fallon,"Last night was Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs. The air conditioning stopped working during the game, which made it feel like 90 degrees inside. Or as football players, baseball players, tennis players, soccer players, and runners put it, “Must be rough.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, LeBron James sat on the bench for the final four minutes of the game. And what’s crazy is his teammates still kept passing him the ball."
Jimmy Fallon,I can’t believe how hot it got during that game. It was so hot that even the LOSING team dumped Gatorade on its coach.
Jimmy Fallon,Tomorrow is the Belmont Stakes. California Chrome will try to become the first horse in 36 years to win the Triple Crown. And he's going to have to do it without air conditioning.
Craig Ferguson,"It is a great day here in Los Angeles. Gay Pride Weekend starts today, and Sunday night right here on CBS is the Tony Awards. Coincidence?"
Craig Ferguson,"The new Tom Cruise movie opens today. It's called ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Tom Cruise is an intergalactic warrior fighting to save our planet from aliens. I have no idea who he plays in the movie.  "
Craig Ferguson,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" is about a guy who's forced to relive the same thing over and over and over again, day after day after day. I can't relate at all."
Craig Ferguson,"Today's a great day for Sweden. It's their ""National Day."" It's the day Sweden celebrates independence from Denmark. Sweden's about 400 miles from Russia. That means they've still got a few years before Putin gets to them."
