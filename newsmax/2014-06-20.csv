Craig Ferguson," A big movie opened today. I'm very excited about it. ""Jersey Boys."" It's based on the Broadway play. It's about the hot musical group all the kids love â€” Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. "
Craig Ferguson," Their biggest hit was ""Big Girls Don't Cry."" It came out in 1962, the year I was born. That's why my nickname growing up was ""Big girl."" "
Craig Ferguson," To be honest, I don't know how well ""Jersey Boys"" is going to do. People in Los Angeles can't relate to a movie about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Because people here have no idea what a season is. "
Craig Ferguson," This movie is directed by Clint Eastwood. It's great to see Clint Eastwood back in the director's chair, instead of yelling at chairs. "
