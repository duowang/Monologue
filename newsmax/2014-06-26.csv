Conan O'Brian,"The U.S. lost to Germany today, but because FIFA rules dictate that teams get one point for a tie, three points for a win, and zero points for a loss, and both the U.S. and Portugal had a score of four, and because the U.S. had a higher goal differential, the U.S. still advances. That's the rules â€” and that in a nutshell is why Americans don't follow soccer."

Craig Ferguson,It was so wet during the World Cup game that dolphins were getting stuck in the net. It was so wet that I saw Russell Crowe float by in an ark. It was so wet the new U.S. goalie is Aquaman. So wet the winners received a ShamWow!
