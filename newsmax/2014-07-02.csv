Jimmy Kimmel," I'm trying to figure out what to make for the Fourth of July. Hamburgers and hot dogs get a lot of attention, but the Fourth is really the blueberry's day to shine. When you need a blue food to round out your red, white, and blue items, there's nowhere else to turn but the blueberry. "
Jimmy Kimmel," Every year, the blueberry has it right where it wants us. I say good for the blueberry. It deserves it. "
Jimmy Kimmel," In Iran there's a TV show, a sitcom â€” it's weird that they even have a sitcom. But it's a rip-off of ""Modern Family."" They use Iranian actors and make shot-for-shot re-creations with the same plots and jokes. But their ""Modern Family"" has no gay characters. The most modern family on Iranian TV up to this point is the Flintstones. "
Jimmy Kimmel," Seven Stones is a traditional game they play in the Middle East where teams compete to build and destroy a pile of rocks. ""Seven Stones"" is followed by ""How I Met Your Mullah."" "
