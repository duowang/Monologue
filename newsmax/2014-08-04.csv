Jimmy Kimmel,"Happy birthday to President Obama. He turned 53 today, according to his birth certificate. The truth is he's actually 55 years old but Congress blocked his last two birthdays. "

Jimmy Fallon,"""Sesame Street"" says it may take legal action against people in Times Square who dress up like its characters. Seriously? Look at the people they’d be suing. What do they expect to win in the lawsuit? A flask of whiskey and an IOU to a bookie? "

Craig Ferguson,"It is our president's birthday. It's also the birthday of NASCAR champ Jeff Gordon. Jeff Gordon and President Obama are very different, of course. One's a guy who spent his whole life turning left and is hated by NASCAR fans. And the other one? Jeff Gordon."
Craig Ferguson,"I love it when people here in L.A. pretend to know what NASCAR is. They'll say, ""Is that the one with the car?"" Or: ""Do those cars run on gasoline? I can't endorse this. Can't they use Priuses and fuel them with kale?"""
Craig Ferguson,"The annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally starts August 4. But times have changed. Now even biker gangs are into recycling. When the motorcycle rally is over, the gangs go around responsibly collecting trash, bottles, and broken teeth. "
Craig Ferguson,"These days any group of bikers can call themselves a motorcycle gang. Some gangs are really bad, like Sons of Anarchy. Other gangs are just orthodontists who go up the highway on a Sunday afternoon."
