Jimmy Kimmel,"Paris Hilton has a new dog. But not just any dog. A dog she paid $13,000 for. The breeder that she bought it from named the dog ""Mr. Amazing"" — I guess because it's amazing they were able to get somebody to pay $13,000 for a dog. "

Craig Ferguson,"The U.N. delegates fan out across Manhattan to take advantage of diplomatic immunity. They do dangerous stuff just because they can, like get speeding tickets. They can even take pictures of Alec Baldwin. "
Craig Ferguson,"It's always fun when people who can't stand each other come together, make speeches, and glare at each other in silent hatred, knowing they won't have to see each other for a whole year. It's like international Thanksgiving."
