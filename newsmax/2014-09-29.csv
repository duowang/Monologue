Conan O'Brian,George Clooney got married in Italy. His bachelor party was held over the course of the last 30 years.
Conan O'Brian,You may be able to tell from my voice that I have a little bit of a cold tonight. But it's nothing that can't be cured by applause.
Conan O'Brian,"Microsoft has announced it's going to open its first flagship store in Manhattan. The Microsoft Store is expected to be just like the Apple Store, but without all of those pesky lines in front. "
Conan O'Brian,"North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has not appeared in public for weeks. There are rumors he's sick due to too much cheese, fried chicken, and beer. Sounds like someone is applying for American citizenship."
Craig Ferguson,"George Clooney is off the market. Clooney and his bride got married in Italy on Saturday, and two days later they are still married! The wedding was so beautiful, it already won six Oscars."
Craig Ferguson,"Matt Damon was at the wedding, but Ben Affleck was not. That's because the Italian church has a very strict ""One Batman"" rule."
Craig Ferguson,"My advice to Clooney is to remember that marriage is complicated. It starts out pretty good, but then there are long rough patches, times when you want to leave. Oh, no, wait. I was thinking of ""Oceans 13."""
Craig Ferguson,It will be strange seeing George Clooney with a wedding ring. Seeing Clooney with a wedding ring is like seeing Mel Gibson with a yarmulke. Or like seeing Matthew McConaughey with a shirt on. Or like seeing Honey Boo Boo with shoes. Or like seeing the Lakers with a victory. Or like seeing Bruce Jenner with a wrinkle. 
David Letterman,"Over the weekend, George Clooney got married. Matt Damon and Julia Roberts were there. What was it, a wedding or a heist? "

Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday, Kenyan runner Dennis Kimetto ran the world's fastest marathon by finishing the Berlin Marathon in 2 hours, 2 minutes, and 57 seconds. He also set another record by being the first guy from Kenya to be named Dennis. "
Jimmy Kimmel,It's National Coffee Day today. Legend has it that coffee was discovered in the sixth century by an Ethiopian goat herder. He built a stand out of branches from an olive tree and started charging the goats $6 a cup for them. And the rest is history. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"One of the most expensive coffees in the world is made by feeding beans to a creature-like cat. It eats the beans and they travel through its system, and when they come out the beans have a rich, mellow flavor. The guy that figured that out must have really loved coffee. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"At one point or another, most everyone that drinks coffee has had his name spelled wrong on a coffee cup. I have a friend named Joe, and even his name has been spelled wrong. Not only is his name Joe, but they call coffee Joe, so it's the one name they should know how to spell. "
