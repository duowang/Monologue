David Letterman,"In London you can buy a hamburger for $1,700. Now, wait a minute, before you start bellyaching, yes, it comes with fries. It's $1,700. It's called the McSucker. "
Jimmy Fallon,"It’s reported that President Obama may take executive action to shut down the prison in Guantanamo Bay. It will backfire when the terrorists there say, ""We're not going out there. Those new terrorists are scary! I got four meals a day here and I get my nails done. I like it here."""
Jimmy Fallon,"President Obama may close the Guantanamo prison. When asked how he plans on letting the prisoners out, Obama said, ""I'll replace all the guards with Secret Service agents."" They'll just wander out. "
Jimmy Fallon,This is kind of weird. This week Obama criticized the GOP for being the party of billionaires — while he was speaking at a fundraiser at a billionaire's house! 
Jimmy Fallon,I don't see how that story could get any worse. But did you see the name of that billionaire? He was Rich Richman. Are you kidding me? Rich Richman is the guy's name? That sounds like a Batman villain. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Rich Richman? Come on. Obama would have stayed longer, but he was late for his lunch with Dollars McMoneybags."
