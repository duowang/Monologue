Jimmy Kimmel,"A little boy dressed like a pumpkin said ""Trick or treat"" at 8 a.m. What are you supposed to do — make him an omelet? "

Jimmy Kimmel,"If you came to my house at 8 in the morning, I would turn a hose on you. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Daylight saving time ends this weekend. Don't forget to change the clocks in your house on Sunday, and the one in your car sometime in the next six to eight weeks."
Jimmy Fallon,"Happy Halloween. It seems like people are going all out with their costumes this year. In fact, last night the Cleveland Cavaliers went as the Knicks."
Jimmy Fallon,The Cavaliers lost their season opener against the Knicks in LeBron James' first game back in Cleveland. LeBron felt a little slow and awkward out there. Then he looked down and realized that former Miami teammate Dwayne Wade was still hanging onto him. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Health officials in countries affected by Ebola are encouraging people to stop shaking hands, and instead give an “Ebola handshake,” which is when you bump elbows with someone. That would be a great idea if they hadn't spent the past five years telling us to sneeze into our elbows. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Attorney General Eric Holder said the only person who could play him in a movie is Denzel Washington. Do you know who I think should play Holder? Oprah's boyfriend, Stedman. "

Craig Ferguson,"I saw a kid dressed in bones. I said, ""You a skeleton?"" He said, ""No, I'm a CBS viewer."" Then I saw a kid dressed as an old woman. I said, ""You a grandma?"" He said, ""No, I'm Bruce Jenner."" "
