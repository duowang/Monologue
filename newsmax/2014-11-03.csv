Conan O'Brian,Yesterday was the New York City Marathon. The marathon was won in record time by a Democrat candidate running away from President Obama. 
Conan O'Brian,"Tomorrow is Election Day. That's the day we Americans wake up, consider our options, and then remember we didn't register to vote."
Conan O'Brian,Daredevil Nik Wallenda broke a record when he walked blindfolded between two Chicago skyscrapers. Wallenda said he didn't do it to set a record. He did it because that's the safest way these days to walk through Chicago.
Conan O'Brian,Christian Bale has dropped out of the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic. He was going to play Steve Jobs. He explained that he doesn't want to be typecast as a guy who wears all black and has a lot of gadgets.
Craig Ferguson,"In Afghanistan researchers have found something called the ""fanged vampire deer."" It is an animal that hasn't been seen for 50 years. To be fair, if I lived in Afghanistan I would be keeping a low profile too. "
Craig Ferguson,The fanged vampire deer looks like what you'd get if Dracula hooked up with Bambi.
Craig Ferguson,Apparently Tom Cruise is dating Lindsay Lohan. I think this is just a rumor started by the only people who desperately want it to be true — late-night talk-show hosts. We pray to the comedy gods for something like this.
Craig Ferguson,"Tom and Lindsay are dating. I can't believe this happens just as I'm about to get out of the late-night game. I might have to do another show. Just when I thought I was out, they keep pulling me back in. "
David Letterman,Yesterday was the New York City Marathon. Republicans won in a landslide. 
Jimmy Fallon,Mary Keitany from Kenya won the women’s race at the New York City Marathon. You can tell she was fast because guys on the street didn't even have time to finish their catcalls. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Mary was fast. Experts say it's one of the most impressive races they've seen a woman run. Then Hillary said, “Stay tuned.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"Politicians are really getting desperate. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sent out a final fundraising email to Democrats with the subject line, “I'm begging.” Because what better way to show you're a strong leader than acting like you're drunk and dialing your ex? "
Jimmy Fallon,Last night daredevil Nik Wallenda successfully completed a tightrope walk of 500 feet between two Chicago skyscrapers. And then he took part in an even more dangerous stunt — walking through Chicago on the ground.
Jimmy Kimmel,Last night daredevil Nik Wallenda walked blindfolded between two Chicago skyscrapers. The Discovery Channel used a 10-second delay so producers would have time to cut away if anything went wrong — thereby depriving viewers of the reason they were tuning in.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Here’s what I was thinking about today. If Nik Wallenda had mailed in an absentee election ballot and fell to his death last night, would his vote tomorrow still count? "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Did you know more Americans will go to Starbucks tomorrow than will go to the polls to vote? I made that up, but it sounds kind of true, doesn't it? "
Jimmy Kimmel,Starbucks had a disappointing quarter revenue-wise. They might want to reconsider their business model of selling one mini-muffin to an unemployed writer who then sits there for 10 hours working on his screenplay without buying anything else. 
Seth Meyers,"Tomorrow is the midterm elections. It's very important, so don't forget to head down to your local polling place and cancel out your dad's vote. "
Seth Meyers,Don't ever let anyone tell you your vote doesn't count. You can cancel out your dad's vote. 
Seth Meyers,"The New York Marathon was held yesterday. The winning time was two hours, 10 minutes, and 55 seconds. Even more amazing, that is exactly how long it took my cab to get from 14th Street to 19th Street. "
Seth Meyers,"Members of the Danish National Chamber Orchestra released a video of themselves performing while eating the world's hottest chili peppers. In response, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released a video of themselves eating a Danish. "
