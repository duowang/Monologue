David Letterman,"The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has new balloons this year including the Pillsbury Doughboy balloon and the first openly gay balloon. Also the Thomas Tank Engine balloon, and they even have the Ebola nurse balloon. "
Jimmy Fallon,"After a six-year battle, the Senate will vote next week to begin construction on the Keystone XL pipeline, which is an oil pipeline that runs from Canada to the Gulf Coast. They're hoping the pipeline will provide enough oil to cover Kim Kardashian's next photo shoot."
Jimmy Fallon,"The pipeline would run from Canada to the Gulf Coast. It'll be the biggest underground structure leading into the U.S. Then people in Mexico said, “Eh . . . second biggest.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"This week Bill Clinton tweeted a photo of himself reading George W. Bush's new book “41.” Then George W. Bush responded to that post on Instagram. Then John McCain said ""You two are hilarious"" by telegraph."
Jimmy Fallon,"There are reports that leaders from ISIS and al-Qaida met at a farm house in Syria last week, and agreed to work together against their common enemies. That story again: Two radical terrorist groups managed to do what two American political parties cannot. "
Craig Ferguson,"Happy 60th birthday to new-age star Yanni. It's also Prince Charles' birthday today. Here's the thing, though. He turns 66. One more six and you would have the number of the beast. "
Craig Ferguson,"Prince Charles celebrates his birthday the same day ""Dumb and Dumber To"" opens. Coincidence? "
Craig Ferguson,"Now Jim Carrey of ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and Prince Charles are very different, of course. One's a cartoony character with bad teeth who really makes me laugh. The other one is Jim Carrey. "
Craig Ferguson,"""Dumb and Dumber To"" might have a little bit of potty humor. If you don't like middle-aged guys telling jokes about pee-pee and poo-poo, why are you watching this show? "
Craig Ferguson,Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels refused to do this movie without each other. That's sweet. My sidekick Geoff and I have a similar agreement regarding talk shows. Unless Andy Richter's available.
