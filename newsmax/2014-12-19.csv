Craig Ferguson,"This is the last show, of course, of ""The late Late Show."" I really didn't know what to do. I thought I'd do a monologue. Then I thought: Well why? I don't have anything else left to say."
Craig Ferguson,"The people that made this show are you. You came to a show that — let's be honest, a bit of a fixer-upper. And it kind of stayed that way."
Craig Ferguson,"I think that we've managed to do here is make something that wasn't here before. So in that sense maybe it is a piece of art. It didn't exist. Now it does and you'll be able to find it forever on YouTube or wherever. No, sorry. What I meant to say is the CBS website. "
Craig Ferguson,I wanted to do this show and now we've done this show. And if you will indulge me in whatever I do next I'd be very grateful because my kids are still young.
