David Letterman,Let's talk about the big game yesterday. The Seahawks beat the Broncos 43-8. The Broncos are blaming it on a traffic study.
Conan O'Brian,"On Saturday before the Super Bowl, Peyton Manning received the NFL's MVP award for the season. Yeah, unfortunately it was immediately intercepted by a Seahawk. "
Conan O'Brian,"After appearing in a commercial during last night's Super Bowl, people are accusing Bob Dylan of selling out. Today Dylan responded by saying, ""Everyone needs to calm down, have a Bud Light, and relax at a Sandals Resort."""
Jimmy Kimmel,It wasn't much of a Super Bowl game. The Seahawks beat the Broncos 43-8. You know how after the game the winning players go to Disney World? Some of the Seahawks went halfway through the third quarter. 
Jimmy Kimmel,It cost $4 million for a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl. I'm always surprised at which companies elect to pay that. How did a pistachio company afford $4 million? What kind of mark-up are they getting on those nuts?  
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Super Bowl was on Fox, so the traditional pre-game sit-down with President Obama went to Bill O'Reilly. The interview got off to a rocky start. O'Reilly asked Obama, ""Where you were born was football played with your feet?"" And it went downhill from there."
Jimmy Kimmel,"At the end of the interview O'Reilly said he thinks Obama's ""heart is in the right place."" What does that mean? That's basically saying that I don't think he’s destroying America intentionally."
Jay Leno,Did you all see that game yesterday? Was that the worst Super Bowl ever? It was 43 to 8. The Puppy Bowl on Animal Planet was more competitive than that.
Jay Leno,"The Broncos couldn’t move the ball. The last time I saw a Bronco going that slow, OJ was driving it through L.A. "
Jay Leno,"While he was at the game, Governor Chris Christie was up to his old tricks. It turns out he blocked three lines at the concession stand. "
Jay Leno,Jimmy Fallon is here tonight. He’s not here to talk. He’s helping me pack. 
Craig Ferguson,How about that Super Bowl? Some of you may expect me to make jokes about the Broncos. I won't do that. To me it's just beating a dead horse.
Craig Ferguson,"Well done, Seattle. I think they needed this to cement their reputation. Before last night, the meanest guy from Seattle was ""Frasier."""
Craig Ferguson,Poor Broncos. Experts said they haven't seen something crushed like that in New Jersey since Chris Christie's beanbag chair.
Craig Ferguson,"The Broncos looked so bad, even the L.A. Lakers said, ""This is kind of embarrassing to watch."" Peyton Manning had such a bad night that Tim Tebow said, ""I could have done that."""
