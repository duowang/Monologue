David Letterman,"They've discontinued Moviefone. If you folks are sad, press 1. If you couldn't care less, press 2. "
Craig Ferguson,"The Oscars are on Sunday. They are kind of like the Westminster Dog Show, except with more blow dryers."
Craig Ferguson,"Some people call the Oscars ""the gay Super Bowl."" I don't think that's fair. I think it's balanced. This year Ellen DeGeneres is hosting. Bette Midler is performing. There will be a tribute to ""The Wizard of Oz."" OK, I take it back. Even the Tony Awards are saying, ""This is a pretty gay awards show."""
Craig Ferguson,This year's Oscars are being held a week later than usual. That was so they don't have to go up against the Winter Olympics. Good move on the Academy's part. Never make viewers choose between seeing a bunch of A-list movie stars and the curling semi-finals.
Craig Ferguson,Did you like the women's curling last week in the Olympics? That is only time you'll see a woman sweep these days.
