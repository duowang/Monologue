David Letterman,"The new ""Godzilla"" opens this weekend. In this movie, Godzilla is the first openly gay lizard."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Over the weekend, the new ""Godzilla"" movie came out. I don't know how Godzilla doesn't hurt himself. I once had to go to the emergency room after stepping on a Lego piece."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Clippers got knocked out of the NBA playoffs last night. Jack Nicholson, who has been sitting courtside at Lakers games for decades, was there. That had to be a mistake, right? He got confused."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Sterling's attorney sent a letter to the NBA, rejecting his lifetime ban and refusing to pay the $2.5 million fine they hit him with. In case you are keeping track, Donald Sterling is 0 for 80 at making good decisions this year."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Even if Sterling wins the lawsuit, why would you want to own a team on which all of your players wish you were dead? He should pack those giant bags under his eyes and get out of L.A."
Jimmy Fallon,Donald Sterling is now planning to sue the NBA for banning him from the league. That’s good because it’s the only way he'll ever see a court again.
Jimmy Fallon,"This week the FCC rolled out a new service that lets people text 911 for help. That'll mean if you're driving and you see an accident, you can cause another accident. "
Jimmy Fallon,"The stadium that will host the opening match of the World Cup still isn’t ready yet because there are problems with 20,000 seats. When asked what’s wrong with the seats, officials said, “There’s no stadium built around them.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"A new report found that the average life expectancy for women in the U.S. is 81, while the average life expectancy for men is 76. Or as both husbands and wives put it, “Good.”"
Craig Ferguson,"""Godzilla"" opens today. In the original movies, Godzilla always attacked Tokyo. But today Godzilla is such a revered hero, Tokyo actually has a statue of him. A city having a statue of the very thing that destroyed it? That would be like the L.A. Clippers having a statue of Donald Sterling. Like Blockbuster having a statue of Netflix. Or like Conan having a statue of Jay Leno."
Craig Ferguson,"Do you know who's in the new ""Godzilla"" movie? Elizabeth Olsen, the sister of the Olsen twins. She is not a twin. She is just an Olsen single. So she's used to being around weird, scary creatures."
Craig Ferguson,"I'm sure the new ""Godzilla"" will be a success, and I'm sure Godzilla will be getting more work. You'll probably be seeing him on the next season of ""Downton Abbey."""
Craig Ferguson,"There have been 28 Godzilla movies. They include ""Son of Godzilla,"" ""Godzilla vs. Mothra,"" ""2 God 2 Zilla,"" and ""Godzilla vs. Tyler Perry."""
