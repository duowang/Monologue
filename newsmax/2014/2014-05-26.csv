Craig Ferguson,"It's Memorial Day. Or as CBS calls it, ""Make the immigrant go to work"" day."
Craig Ferguson,"If I have to be here, I'm just phoning it in. In other words, just like every other night for the past decade."
Craig Ferguson,"On this day in 1897, Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" was published. Happy birthday, Dracula! You know who else's birthday it is? Lenny Kravitz. Dracula and Lenny Kravitz are very different, of course. One's an elegantly dressed scoundrel who swoops into my dreams at night and bites me on the neck. And the other one: Dracula."
Craig Ferguson,"I've read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula."" It's a really creepy book. A tremendous sense of menace runs through it. The sense of menace in the book is like the sense of menace you get when you're alone with a house cat."
Craig Ferguson,"I've always loved the name ""Bram Stoker."" Nobody calls their kid Bram anymore. Come to think of it, nobody calls their kid Dracula anymore either. Your move, Gwyneth Paltrow."
