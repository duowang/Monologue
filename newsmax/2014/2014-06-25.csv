David Letterman,"During the World Cup, Uruguay is playing Italy and one of their players bites an Italian player. How many of you folks have ever been bitten by a Uruguayan?"
Conan O'Brian," The World Cup has an official song. The official anthem is ""We Will Find a Way."" It narrowly beat out the other contender, ""I Feel Someone's Teeth in My Shoulder."" "
Conan O'Brian," Luis Suarez, the Uruguayan player who bit an opponent, may get banned for two years. On the plus side, he has just signed a million-dollar endorsement deal to promote rabies. "
Conan O'Brian," Both the U.S. and German teams have very good goalies, so many are predicting a very low-scoring game tomorrow. So don't expect to see another one of those 1-0 blowouts. "
Conan O'Brian," England was knocked out of the World Cup. It's the most English people wiped out at one time since the last episode of ""Game of Thrones."" "
Jimmy Kimmel,The big story at the World Cup is a player from Uruguay who appeared to bite a player from Italy on the shoulder. Either that or he's a very bad kisser. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"The player from Uruguay was suspended for biting twice before. FIFA, the governing body for soccer, is determining whether they'll suspend him again. That to me is ridiculous. If he did it a third time, just pull his teeth. "
Jimmy Kimmel,A piece of rock 'n' roll history was sold yesterday. Some of Bob Dylan's handwritten lyrics from 1965 went up for auction and got $2 million. Paying $2 million for Bob Dylan lyrics is a good way to know that Bob Dylan would have hated you in 1965.  
Jimmy Kimmel,"The reason the Dylan lyrics are so valuable is because if you buy them, you'll be the only one in the world who knows what Dylan is singing. "
Craig Ferguson,"In England a major highway had to be closed yesterday because a truck overturned. And the truck was filled with instant mashed potatoes. I was thinking that there must be a joke in this, but I couldn't think of one. "
Craig Ferguson,"A truck overturned full of mashed potatoes â€” thank God this didn't happen in Los Angeles. They'd be saying, ""Oh no, carbs. Carbs are falling! Quick, someone overturn a truck full of kale. No, don't waste the kale."""
