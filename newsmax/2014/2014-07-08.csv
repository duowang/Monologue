David Letterman,It's summer in New York City. It's 91 and steamy — like Joan Rivers! 
Seth Meyers,A new rumor has surfaced that the next iPhone will feature an all-glass exterior. Because why should just the front be cracked?
Seth Meyers,"According to a new report, millennials view smartphones as more important than deodorant. That makes sense. Nobody ever totals their car because they were staring at their deodorant."
Seth Meyers,"This summer New Yorkers will be able to order delivery food to sunbathing spots in Central Park. Although if you have to order delivery to the place where you’re sunbathing, you probably shouldn’t be sunbathing."

Craig Ferguson,"On this day in 1776 in Philadelphia, the Liberty Bell rang to announce the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence. Philadelphia's called the City of Brotherly Love. The name comes from the Greek word ""filla,"" meaning brother, and ""delphia,"" meaning cheesesteak. "
Craig Ferguson,Cheesesteak is the dish Philadelphia is known for. I don't know what dish we're known for here in L.A. It may be kale salad that you can eat and then throw up later because you have an audition.
Craig Ferguson,"A Philly cheesesteak is made of steak, bread, cheese, onions, and a complete disregard for your health."
Craig Ferguson,The baseball team in Philadelphia is the Phillies. I always thought that was kind of a lazy name. It's like calling a team the New York Yorkies or the Atlanta Ta-Ta's.
