Jimmy Kimmel,"The official ballot is one line: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" And that's it. Why is it that I have to go through 18 pages of terms and conditions to download iOS 8 while a whole country can secede from the United Kingdom by checking a box that says ""Yes""?"
Jimmy Fallon,President Obama hosted a picnic at the White House today for members of Congress. Obama said it was a great opportunity to gather every member of Congress in one place — so he could turn on the sprinklers. Payback!
