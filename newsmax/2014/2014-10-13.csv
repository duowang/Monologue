David Letterman,"Happy Columbus Day to everybody. Columbus had three ships: the Kim, the Kourtney, and the Khloe. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"A lot of people have a three-day weekend because of Columbus Day. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and 522 years later a lot of people still get Monday off to celebrate. No one's received more credit for getting lost than Christopher Columbus in the history of mankind. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Unlike Columbus, if a pizza delivery guy got lost nobody would give him a day. They wouldn't even give him a tip. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"As the story goes, Columbus was aiming for India, wound up in the Caribbean, and Americans have been terrible at geography ever since. "
Seth Meyers,Last week North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un missed a ceremony marking the 69th anniversary of the country. Experts say it's especially strange because he knew cake would be there. 
Seth Meyers,"Nobody knows where he is but the U.S. national security adviser says there is no evidence that Kim Jong Un has been overthrown. If anything, he was probably just tipped over. "
Jimmy Fallon,"President Obama played his 200th round of golf yesterday. Then Democrats said, “You know what? He can do whatever he wants as long as he's not trying to campaign for us.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"President Obama was in California over the weekend to attend a fundraiser hosted by the creator of “Farmville.” Obama and the creator of ""Farmville"" have a lot in common. They both really wish it was still 2009. "
Jimmy Fallon,A new survey found that people in New York are the most generous tippers at restaurants. You can tell the money's good because the other day I met an actress who dreams of becoming a waitress.
Jimmy Fallon,"Runners from Kenya came in first, second, and third in the Chicago Marathon yesterday. Even crazier, all three runners turned out to be one dude lapping everyone. "
Craig Ferguson,Last week was the big fundraiser for President Obama hosted by Gwyneth Paltrow. It was hosted at her house. And people say Obama never reaches out to the inner city.
Craig Ferguson,A fundraiser at Gwyneth Paltrow's house was a good idea for the president. He found the one person in America with lower approval ratings than his. 
Craig Ferguson,Gwyneth Paltrow told the president he was so handsome that she couldn't speak properly. I wish Obama would get a little bit more handsome so she would shut up forever.
Craig Ferguson,"Gwyneth Paltrow's neighbors were very upset because they didn't know about the fundraiser beforehand. Wow, that's the first time the Secret Service managed to keep a secret. Take that, people who can have me killed! "
