Jimmy Kimmel,Rats are considered to be roommates in New York. All you can do is ask them to pitch in on rent and hope for the best.

Jimmy Fallon,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made his first public appearance yesterday in over 40 days. But since he saw his shadow, that now means 60 more years of nuclear winter."
