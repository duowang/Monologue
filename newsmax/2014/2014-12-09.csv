Craig Ferguson,A man in Dublin punched a hole in a $10 million painting by Claude Monet. And today he was sentenced to five years in prison. For punching a painting? There are going to be more fists going where they shouldn't. 
Craig Ferguson,"Why would an Irish dude walk into a museum and punch a Monet? If he punched a Rothko, I'd understand. Am I right, art majors?"

Craig Ferguson,I want to check my Twitter feed now to see if anyone's angry at me for that Rothko comment.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Every year Americans spend millions of dollars on Christmas gifts for their pets, which makes no sense to me. Your pet doesn't know it's Christmas. In fact, your pet doesn't even know it's a pet, so giving your cat a sweater is about as useful as giving your microwave a hat. "
