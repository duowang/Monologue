David Letterman,We've broken the back of winter. And now here in New York City it's the beginning of the pothole season. Earlier today Mayor de Blasio cut the ribbon on a brand-new one over on 8th Ave.
Conan O'Brian,"Russia's Vladimir Putin appeared in public for the first time after a mysterious 10-day absence. Putin said it took him that long to recover from the finale of ""The Bachelor."""
Conan O'Brian,Yesterday was the L.A. Marathon. It's the only time of year you see someone running in the streets of Los Angeles when it's not the end of a car chase.
Conan O'Brian,"Some people are still angry about the letter written by Republicans to Iran. It's also not helping that they said, ""Dear Iran or Iraq, we can never keep you two straight."""
Seth Meyers,"After a mysterious absence, Vladimir Putin appeared today in public for the first time in nearly two weeks. You know what that means — a boob job. And we're going to find out quick because that guy doesn't wear a shirt a lot. "
Seth Meyers,March Madness is upon us. That's the big tournament where you start out with 64 teams and in only three weeks you're down to no girlfriend. 
Seth Meyers,"Pope Francis said that one of the things he misses most about ordinary life is the ability to go out and eat pizza without being recognized. I wouldn't worry. Nobody's going to believe the guy who works at the pizza place when he says, ""Hey, you know who came in today? The Pope."""
Jimmy Fallon,"During his weekly address to the nation, President Obama discussed higher education and said, “The most important skill you can sell is your knowledge.” Or as English majors working at Starbucks put it, “No it's not."""
Jimmy Fallon,"This weekend President Obama attended the annual Gridiron Club Dinner, and during his speech he joked that he is getting older and crankier. Which explains why he announced he no longer supports President Obama. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Disney's live-action movie “Cinderella” — which also featured a short “Frozen” cartoon — came in No. 1 at the box office this weekend, with an estimated $70 million. That story again: A short “Frozen” cartoon made $70 million this weekend — and “Cinderella” was involved toward the end there, too."
Jimmy Fallon,A grandmother in South Africa celebrated her 100th birthday on Saturday by going skydiving. It's pretty impressive — most people turning 100 usually go the other direction in the sky. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"We are here in Austin, Texas, for a whole week — because that's how long it takes to get to the front of the line at Franklin Barbecue."
Jimmy Kimmel,I've been doing a lot of drinking here in Austin too. Here's how you know you're having a good time — when you go for coffee in the morning and realize that the key to your hotel room is still in the door from the night before.
Jimmy Kimmel,"In addition to eating, there's also a music festival going on in Austin right now. For a minute I thought people were standing in line to get their beards trimmed. It's like a swarm of hipster locusts descended on the city."
Jimmy Kimmel,The festival started last Friday and goes through Sunday. Al Gore kicked things off. You know Austin isn't like the rest of Texas when the guy they bring in to get the crowd fired up is a Democrat who hates oil.
