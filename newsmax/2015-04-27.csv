Jimmy Kimmel,"Jenner also identified himself as a conservative Republican. He said he believes that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell will support him and advocate for transgender issues. Yeah, of course they will. They're probably having the buttons printed as we speak. "
Jimmy Kimmel,It turns out after all of these years that instead of the Kardashians we should have been keeping up with Bruce.
