James Corden," Happy Cinco de Mayo. Today is the day Americans celebrate Mexicans beating the French in the Battle of Puebla by getting blind drunk, listening to mariachi music, and then vomiting in a cab. Or as we call it in Britain — Tuesday. "
James Corden," I just moved to the states and I've learned that Cinco de Mayo is just a reason to drink. Until now I thought Americans had to fall back on St. Patrick's Day, the Fourth of July, Fat Tuesday, Halloween, Hanukkah, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, President's Day, any sporting event, any barbecue, Thanksgiving, or Christmas if they needed an excuse to get drunk on a weekday.

James Corden," The Internet has spoken and it said that girls love ""dad bods."" But the examples they used for dad bods were Jon Hamm and Leonardo DiCaprio. OK, one, they don't have kids so they aren't dads. Two, they are among the most handsome men the world has to offer. That article shouldn't read ""Girls love dad bods."" It should read, ""Girls love millionaire movie stars."" "
James Corden," Somehow, millionaire movie stars have always gotten women to find them attractive. If you're a millionaire movie star I don't think you'll ever hear, ""I'd like you a lot more if you had your dad's body."" "
