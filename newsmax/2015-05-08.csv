David Letterman,"New York City has a rat problem. There must be three to four million rats running loose, but finally, Mayor de Blasio has declared war on rats. Here's what he's going to do. He's going to bring in more coyotes. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Of course I'm going to kick off things with this monologue here, or as it's known tonight, the Bonologue. That's right, we have U2 on the show tonight. "
Jimmy Fallon,"U2 wasn't supposed to be here, but when I opened up my iTunes they just popped up. "
Jimmy Fallon,"People are being really picky about the upcoming election. I read that Americans do not want the next president to be a first-term senator, be over 65, or have a former president in the family. Then the Secret Service said, ""Hey, whoever slips through slips through. No promises."""
Jimmy Fallon,"A house panel in Texas has approved full marijuana legalization for the state. Yeah, meaning Texas could go from having dude ranches to ""Dude, ranches."""
