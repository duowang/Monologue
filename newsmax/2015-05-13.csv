David Letterman," I've been doing a lot of pondering, a lot of ruminating. And I'm not looking at this as a retirement. I'm thinking of this as a multigame suspension. Like Tom Brady. "
Seth Meyers,A 94-year-old man is graduating from West Virginia University after studying at the school on and off for 75 years — though I’m guessing mostly off.
Seth Meyers,"He’s graduating from college at the age of 94. Just imagine how awkward it’s going to be for the commencement speaker when he says, “You have your whole life ahead of you. Except that dude.”"
Seth Meyers,"UC Berkeley students have developed a drone that follows you around, taking selfies of you. Which is a shame because those are exactly the kind of people we should be using the other drones on."
James Corden,"The 2015 college graduates are now hearing advice from commencement speakers about the real world. But there's a group left out in the cold, the ones who fell short of graduation — fifth-year seniors. Congratulations non-graduating senior class — the few in every school brave enough to say, ""You know what? I loved my senior year so much, I think I'll do it all over again."""
James Corden,"There are many successful people who didn't graduate. Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Elton John. You won't be as successful as them because you're watching TV at 1:00 in the morning. But still there's hope, I guess."
James Corden,"You're very smart. You know who isn't smart? The graduating seniors who have to find a job. Little known secret: There aren't any jobs. When your friends were concentrating on their engineering degree, you were engineering a way to put vodka in a watermelon. We congratulate you for that. "
James Corden,"You're right to want to stay in that warm, safe environment where the people are young and hopeful and fresh and alive. I'd be there right now if campus security didn't have my picture on file."
James Corden,"Never again will you live in a world where not only is the beer free but people will offer to pour it into your own mouth for you. Think of yourself as a super senior. The seniorest of all the seniors. You are the class of 2016. Or 2017. Or let's be honest, probably 2018."
Jimmy Fallon,Even the White House is weighing in on the deflate-gate scandal. Yesterday they encouraged Tom Brady to “be mindful of the way he serves as a role model.” And then President Obama stuffed out his cigarette and went golfing at noon on a weekday. 
Jimmy Fallon,"The White House encouraged Tom Brady to be more of a role model. They would’ve said more, but there was a drunken Secret Service agent streaking across the Rose Garden. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Senate Democrats blocked President Obama’s trade bill yesterday because they’re worried it could hurt jobs. It’s not an issue for Republicans, since they’ve all found work as presidential candidates. "
Jimmy Fallon,Whole Foods is planning on opening a new chain of stores that carry lower-priced natural foods aimed at millennials. It's even got a catchy name: Trader Joe’s. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Kim Jong Un reportedly had his defense chief executed after he fell asleep during a meeting. Not only did they execute him, they shot him with an anti-aircraft gun. I'd like to see NBC hire Kim Jong Un to host ""The Apprentice."" His way of firing people is much more exciting than Donald Trump's."
Jimmy Kimmel,Things like that make me glad I live in America — where our political figures are free to fall asleep wherever they want. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Kim Jong Un — it's really Catch-22 with him. If you close your eyes, you get shot for nodding off. If you open them, you get shot for laughing at his haircut. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Expedia released their rankings of the most annoying drivers in America. For the 15th year in a row, the most annoying driver on the road is every driver but you. The survey says the least popular passengers are backseat drivers. I would have said carjackers."
