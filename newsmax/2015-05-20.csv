David Letterman,"I'll be honest with you. It's beginning to look like I'm not going to get ""The Tonight Show."""
Conan O'Brian,"In about 34 minutes David Letterman is going to air his last episode. In 1993, I took over his iconic late-night show. I was a complete unknown with no experience performing on TV. I was totally unprepared for that enormous job. I don't think that could happen today. I don't think the government would allow it."
Conan O'Brian,"I was in way over my head, and with my hair that's saying something."
Conan O'Brian,"After four dreary months, out of the blue we got a message that David Letterman wanted to come on as a guest. Dave was the biggest thing on TV. He didn't go on other people's shows. It was like The Beatles asking Maury Povich if they could stop by and sing a couple of tunes. "
Conan O'Brian,"I have no illusions anyone is watching me this evening. But if there happen to be a few of you out there, I'm going to let you know the exact moment when Dave's show is starting, and I'd like you to switch over. I may be talking to seven viewers at that time, but I really think you should do it. "
