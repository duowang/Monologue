Conan O'Brian,"Welcome to our show in San Diego for Comic-Con week. Comic-Con has been around for 46 years. This is the 46th anniversary of people asking each other: ""Is William Shatner wearing a wig or what?"""
Conan O'Brian,"It's embarrassing when you complement someone on a costume and they say, ""It's not a costume."""
Conan O'Brian,"I've seen a lot of folks dressed as ""The Walking Dead."" Although many of them might be better described as the dead who could stand to do a bit more walking."
Conan O'Brian,"Comic-Con has officially banned selfie sticks and e-cigarettes, which is too bad. Because now when I see someone smoking an e-cigarette, I have nothing to beat them with."
