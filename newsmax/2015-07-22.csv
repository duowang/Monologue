James Corden,"Nicki Minaj is having a beef with the VMAs because she feels they snubbed the video for her song ""Anaconda"" and she tweeted, ""If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year.""

James Corden,"Super hero movies, you're great, but there's just too many of you. In the past five years alone, there have been 22,000 superhero movies.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Sony Pictures Animation won a three-studio bidding war for a movie starring emojis. It’s a nearly seven-figure deal that sold off a pitch — which, for those not familiar with showbiz lingo, means someone went into a meeting with executives and said, ""You know those pictures people send each other? Let's make a movie about them."" And walked out of the office with a million bucks."
