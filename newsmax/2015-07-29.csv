Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump said yesterday that he would love to have Sarah Palin in his administration because she is somebody who knows what's happening. Said Sarah Palin, ""Trump's running for president? When did that happen?"""
Seth Meyers,"Chris Christie said yesterday if he's elected, he'll fight against legalized marijuana, so Colorado and Washington residents had better, quote, ""Smoke that pot now."" Colorado and Washington residents said, ""OK. That was the plan all along. Are you guys trying to trick us? Hey, if you're a cop, you have to tell us. You're eating doughnuts."""
Seth Meyers,"A teen couple has won over $20,000 in scholarship money for making their prom outfits. They made their prom outfits entirely from duct tape. Unfortunately, they had to spend it all on hospital bills after taking the outfits off."
Seth Meyers,"Scientists said yesterday that the T. rex may have had teeth serrated like a steak knife, which may have helped it eat meat more efficiently. Experts believe the T. rex evolved the knife-like teeth after having so much trouble using regular silverware."
James Corden,A designer in New York is developing the world's first spray-on condom. True story. If you're wondering how this works — it doesn't.
James Corden,"There's a new app out called MileHi that allows users to find people on their flight who are looking to have sex. This app is the most downloaded app at check-in and the most deleted app at baggage claim. No one is finding their soul mate on this app. It must be so frustrating when the guy is like, ""I'm not really looking for anything long-term. I'm actually changing planes in Phoenix."""
Jimmy Fallon,"It seems like every day, another candidate comes out of the woodwork. In fact this week, a man from Iowa whose actual legal name is Deez Nuts, announced that he is running for president. Then Americans looked at the other candidates and said, “He can't be worse than DOZE nuts.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"The NFL upheld Tom Brady’s four-game suspension yesterday, and said the decision involved the fact that Brady destroyed his cellphone just before he was investigated. Then Hillary said, “You didn’t have to destroy it — you just switch the SIM card memory chip! Uh, so I’ve heard. I don't know. Bye. Gotta go."""
Jimmy Fallon,"A dentist from Minnesota went on one of those big-game hunting trips in Africa and ended up illegally killing a pretty famous lion named Cecil. So many people hate this guy, Donald Trump is considering him as a running mate. ""This guy is the worst. He’s perfect for my campaign."""
Jimmy Fallon,"A recent study shows that standing at work for long periods of time is bad for you, after earlier research indicated that sitting for too long at work is bad for you. So really the only thing we know is, work is bad for you."
Jimmy Kimmel,"There's a new study that says standing for prolonged periods of time on the job can lead to long-term back pain and musculoskeletal disorders. Which is kind of funny because for the last three years all we've been hearing is how bad it is to sit all day at work. Maybe the problem isn't standing or sitting, maybe the problem is work."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump — there are still 15 months to go in this election, he was all over the news again today. He's on everything all the time. I don't know how he's going to keep up this pace. Donald Trump has reached a saturation level that is nothing short of Kardashian-esque."
Jimmy Kimmel,"A hot new surf destination has been discovered and it's none other than North Korea. Up until this point, surfboards have been used primarily as a means of escape from North Korea. I can't think of any country that embodies the easygoing surfer attitude more than North Korea. The Beach Boys should definitely write a song about this."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The NFL upheld the four-game suspension they imposed on Tom Brady for his suspected role in Deflategate, which upset Tom Brady — he was expecting it to be reduced, especially since one of his colleagues got a two-game suspension for hitting his wife in an elevator."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The league upheld the suspension because they said Tom Brady willfully obstructed his investigation by telling his assistant to destroy his cellphone. The way the NFL is reacting to this, you'd think they caught Tom Brady running a meth lab under Gillette Stadium."
