James Corden,"Steelers linebacker James Harrison made his sons return two school sports trophies that they received just for participating. He said, ""These trophies will be given back until they earn a real trophy."" Why do I feel like James Harrison would be the first dad to volunteer his kids for ""The Hunger Games""?"

We should be able to exist without constant praise and know that achievement is a reward in itself. "

Jimmy Kimmel,There's boxing news. Floyd Mayweather defeated Manny Pacquiao and since that night over 30 lawsuits have been filed alleging the fight was a fraud.

Jimmy Kimmel,"I was there. I paid a lot more than $100 to see that fight. But I can personally attest that it was real. It was a real boring fight, but it was a real fight.
