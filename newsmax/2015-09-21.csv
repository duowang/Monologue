Seth Meyers,"Republican candidate Jeb Bush is struggling to get traction against Donald Trump. Trump is even dominating in Jeb's home state of Florida, where the former governor is behind by 15 points. That makes sense that Florida likes Trump — they're used to life-size cartoon characters with giant heads."
Seth Meyers,"All the presidential candidates are trying to woo millennials. I'm not sure college kids can identify with 22 people desperately fighting for one job. No surprise, the leader in the race to attract them on social media is Hillary Clinton. After all, a Clinton in the White House is the ultimate #ThrowbackThursday."
Seth Meyers,"Hillary has already released a millennial-friendly plan to handle student loan debt, saying no student should have to take out a loan to pay for tuition if attending a four-year public college. Amen. Paying off my student loan debt is the only reason I took this CBS gig. Twelve more years. "

James Corden,"There's a lot of stories in the news today about Airbnb, a website where you can make your house available for people to stay in for a few days. People used to buy expensive security systems to keep you out of their homes and now they're suddenly, like, “Let's invite a stranger to come in here and touch everything.” "
James Corden,"A couple in San Francisco hired a house sitter from trustedhousesitters.com to watch their house while they were away at Burning Man. But instead, the house sitter listed it on Airbnb and earned $2,000 by renting it out. I think you're in trouble when you're using a site called trustedhousesitters.com. "
James Corden,"Nothing makes you seem less trustworthy than saying that you're trustworthy. It's like if a doctor described himself as a very qualified doctor. ""Hello, I'm a very qualified doctor from veryqualifieddoctors.com, and today we’re going to check this thing and I'm going to use one of these."""

Jimmy Kimmel,"The 67th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards were last night. The temperature on the red carpet hit 97 degrees, which means it was only one degree away from turning into a boy band down there. "
Jimmy Kimmel,That kind of heat is dangerous because many of our favorite celebrities are made out of plastic. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Jeffrey Tambor won on his seventh try — best actor in a comedy. Jeffrey Tambor is very funny but I have to say in that category, Donald Trump really got screwed. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Some people are angry because the Emmys showed a montage of clips from shows that went off the air this year. It ruined the endings of certain shows for people who haven't seen them. I was mad they showed the end of ""Boardwalk Empire"" and then I realized the show ended 11 months ago … at this point it's my own fault for not seeing it."
Jimmy Kimmel,"One of the finales they ruined was the end of ""Two and a Half Men."" I'd love to meet the person who was furious they spoiled the finale of that."
