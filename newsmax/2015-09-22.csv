Conan O'Brian,The Pope arrived in the U.S. today. I think that's exciting. The Pope flew into Washington this afternoon on Lifelong Virgin Air. 
Conan O'Brian,"Pope Francis' plane touched down in Washington at 4 p.m. I knew the moment he was here because I felt a disturbance in the guilt. What is that? Catholic, you are. That's what Yoda says. "
Conan O'Brian,"Volkswagen is having a big scandal. Volkswagen has been caught installing secret devices that help them cheat on emissions tests. The CEO said, “I missed the last controversial time here at VW when all we did was make cars for Hitler.”"
Conan O'Brian,A company in Japan has released a robot that's able to simulate some emotion. Either that or Hillary Clinton just made a surprise visit to Japan. 
Conan O'Brian,"In San Diego, a 100-year-old man set five world records at a track meet. He set a record in the 50-meter dash, the 800-meter run and the 100-meter wander off. "
Seth Meyers,"Dr. Ben Carson defended his comments about Muslims being unfit for the presidency, and posted on Facebook that he believes Sharia law is the central tenet of Islam. While most people on Facebook believe “Sharia Law” is a show about a black lady judge. 

"
Seth Meyers,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker dropped out of the presidential race last night. And in related news, a tree fell in a forest."
Seth Meyers,"The last polls before Scott Walker dropped out of the presidential race found the Wisconsin governor was polling at one half of 1 percent. Bobby Jindal said, “What's your secret?”"
Seth Meyers,"Pope Francis will fly on American Airlines while traveling between Washington, New York and Philadelphia, and not, as I had assumed, Virgin. "
Seth Meyers,"According to a new study, there have been more deaths this year from selfie-related incidents than there have been from shark attacks. Good. "

Jimmy Fallon,"Pope Francis arrived in Washington, D.C., today. I saw that President Obama actually picked him up at the airport. When asked how the Pope will get back to the airport, Obama was like, ""Uber? I don't know. It's not my problem."""
Jimmy Fallon,"That's right, President Obama picked up Pope Francis at the airport. Because what better way to alleviate the traffic the Pope is about to cause than sending out a presidential motorcade?"
Jimmy Fallon,"The trip to Washington, D.C., has actually been very educational for the Pope. You know, because he's only ever read about purgatory. "
Jimmy Fallon,"
I saw that top congressional leaders sent a statement to the House and Senate with guidelines for Pope Francis' visit, including a request to not shake his hand. Apparently, they're worried that if politicians touch the Pope they'll burst into flames. 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"In addition to the “no shaking hands,” Congress was given a lot of rules about the Pope's visit. First, there’s ""Don't fake-sneeze just to get an easy blessing out of the Pope."" "
Jimmy Kimmel,"This is a historic day for the United States of America. Pope Francis visited our country for the first time ever today. The Pope is here until Saturday. He's visiting Washington, D.C., New York, and Pennsylvania. Not even going to bother coming to L.A. He said it's a lost cause, no point. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"First up was Cuba. He came straight here from Havana and had a little bit of trouble at customs. They stopped him and went through his stuff. “What is this, sir? You can't bring more than $100 worth of cigars into the country. I don't care if you are the Pope.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I love this Pope, but I wonder about this tweet he posted last week where he wrote, “I ask you to join me in praying for my trip to Cuba and United States. I need your prayers.” Should we be offended by that? Maybe I'm being paranoid. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Pope is a very humble man. He doesn't believe in extravagance. He's not a fan of commercialism or consumerism. With that said, this is how we welcome him here in the United States — with Pope Francis bobble heads, with Pope Francis dolls, T-shirts that say “Pope Is Dope.” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Snoop yesterday launched a marijuana lifestyle website called Mary Jane. Snoop said Mary Jane is a crossroads of pot, culture, business, politics, and health. You know, it's getting harder and harder to tell Snoop Dogg and Gwyneth Paltrow apart. He should consider changing his name to Goop Dog. "
