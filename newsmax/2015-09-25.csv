Seth Meyers,"Everybody see Thursday night's football game? I saw it by accident because I tried to watch my show. Once again, I got bumped by ""Thursday Night Football."" This time, my show didn't start until 12:35 a.m. and last night was my special “Pope Show.” So, football didn't just bump me, it bumped the Pope. Fellas, God gives you all those touchdowns, and this is how you thank him? "
Seth Meyers,"Here in New York, everyone's ecstatic about a visitor to these shores that is inspiring millions to weep tears of joy and devotion. I speak, of course, of the new iPhone 6s. This afternoon, iPhone fans lined up at the Apple Store as the Catholic faithful lined up to see the Pope's procession through Central Park.

Jimmy Fallon,"New research shows that monkeys enjoy movies, and can even follow plot lines. So if you're keeping score — that's monkeys: one, my mom: zero. ""Who's he? Is that the bad guy?"" ""It's a commercial, mom."""
Jimmy Fallon,"This morning, Pope Francis addressed the U.N. General Assembly, and rode around inside the U.N. building in a golf cart. People will never forget what the Pope said as he passed them: ""WHEEE!"""
