I grilled, I sautéed, I made a warm gingerbread cake smothered with a caramelized apple compote with a side of cinnamon whipped cream. It really put me on the couch. Food like that is why they call this season fall instead of stand. "
Seth Meyers,"More good news for Hillary Clinton — Joe Biden is not running for president. As a voter I'm sad to lose Joe Biden but I can understand. Being a candidate sucks.

James Corden,"All the candidates are trying to reinvent themselves, but sometimes they try a little too hard.

Got you — it's strawberry!"" "

I guess the point is some things in life are worth dying for. And bacon is right at the top of those things. "

Do they think it means delicious? 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Meanwhile, Jeb Bush is trying to get momentum going by releasing a new book. It's a collection of emails he sent and received when he was governor of Florida. The book is called ""Reply all."" Because nothing gets people excited like group email."
