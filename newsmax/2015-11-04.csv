Seth Meyers,Ohio voters yesterday rejected a proposal that would have legalized both recreational and medical marijuana.  Pot advocates were so devastated that there was hardly a dry mouth in the house. 
Seth Meyers,"A company has come out with a new waffle maker that cooks batter in the shape of the Death Star from Star Wars. And if you want one, make sure to yell it loud enough for your mom to hear you upstairs."
Seth Meyers,"A woman in California posted a picture that went viral this weekend showing her engagement ring which her fiancée made using a tooth instead of a diamond. Even worse, that is his three month’s salary. "
Seth Meyers,"Starting tomorrow, ""Thursday night football"" will be seen only on NFL network and they're kicking off with a heck of a matchup: The Cleveland Browns versus the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals. It's the battle of Ohio, so Governor John Kasich is going to have to bet a signature regional food item against himself. "
Seth Meyers,"I've opened the book, mainly so I don't have to look at the cover anymore, and it's full of things we've already heard from Trump in his speeches, with little extras, like punctuation.
 
"
Seth Meyers,"Jeb! Just released a brand new e-book entitled ""Reply all."" It's a great way to show you're done making mistakes by naming a book after something people do by accident. "
Seth Meyers,"Jeb Bush clearly needs some help because it feels like his campaign is sleepwalking. Which, admittedly, is a strategy that's working for Ben Carson. "
James Corden,"Yesterday were the midterm elections, otherwise known as the elections that you guys didn't vote in. "
James Corden,"In Ohio, people voted on a referendum which would have had to legalize marijuana in that state, but it did not pass. That's right, it remains illegal to get high in Ohio, which means there is still no legal way to enjoy a Cleveland Browns game. "
James Corden,"People are saying the initiative did not pass because it would have allowed giant corporations to control the marijuana industry. Which is a huge bummer, because I was really excited to buy pot from a place called Starblunts."
James Corden,"At least Ohio got legalization on the ballot. In Arkansas, a proposal to legalize marijuana was rejected because — and I’m not making this up — it had too many spelling and grammar errors. Arkansas: Way to live up to the stereotype!"
Jimmy Fallon,"USA Today's GOP “Power Rankings” had some big shake-ups this week, with Marco Rubio in the lead and Chris Christie in the top five. Yep, Rubio is number one, while Christie is numbers two through five."
Jimmy Fallon,"In one of his books, Ben Carson actually admitted to falling asleep several times while driving his car. He started taking Ubers to be safe, but his drivers kept falling asleep while listening to him talk. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Twitter just changed its star-shaped “favorite” button to a heart-shaped “like” button, and said it’s because the heart is a more universal symbol of liking something. You know, like how people want to see movies that get four hearts, or stay in five-heart hotels."
Jimmy Fallon,"Google announced that it will bring its super-fast internet connection, Google Fiber to cities in Florida. Which makes sense, cuz the first thing people in Florida will do when they get online is Google fiber. “Look at all these Metamucil pics!” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yesterday was Election Day here in the United States. In Ohio they voted no on legalizing marijuana for recreational and medical use and 65 percent of the voters said no. How could Ohio vote against marijuana? They have ""High"" right in the middle of their name. "
Jimmy Kimmel,It is one of the great ironies of life the only way to make marijuana legal is for stoners to leave the house to vote. That obviously didn't happen.
