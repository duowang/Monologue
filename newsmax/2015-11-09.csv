Seth Meyers,"Dr. Ben Carson is drawing intense criticism after reports have surfaced that he may have embellished his history of violence as a teen, his scholarship to West Point, and other parts of his life story. Not only that, but it turns out the twins he separated were fraternal."
Seth Meyers,RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said today that the media is unfairly fixating on Dr. Ben Carson. And Ben Carson said that Reince Priebus is a condition that can result in blindness if left untreated.
Seth Meyers,"Bernie Sanders this weekend argued against the major political fundraising families, saying, “That is not called democracy, that is called oligarchy.”  Bernie, you gotta dumb it down a little. Most Americans think “oligarchy” is that place that serves unlimited breadsticks."
Seth Meyers,The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree arrived on Friday. They’re calling the tree “Jeb” because it’s a dying bush.
Seth Meyers,"A Colorado marijuana dispensary this week is opening the country’s first combination pot store and gas station. On the downside, you’ll have no idea what you’re getting when you order the Premium Diesel. "
Seth Meyers,"As of yesterday the 2016 presidential election is just one year away, which means it's only 11 months until voters start paying attention."
Seth Meyers,Everyone on the GOP side is about to get plenty of face time at tomorrow's fourth Republican debate. All eyes are on Marco Rubio. He looked presidential at the last debate thanks to his brilliant strategy of standing next to Jeb Bush.
Conan O'Brian,"In Mississippi this weekend, a sinkhole swallowed 12 cars in an IHOP parking lot. It’s being called ""the smallest thing ever swallowed at a Mississippi IHOP."""
Conan O'Brian,"SeaWorld is phasing out its killer whale show. Or as Fox News reported it, ""More killers set free under Obama."""
Conan O'Brian,"Ben Carson apparently has a painting of himself with Jesus. When he heard this, Larry King said, ""Big deal, I have a selfie with Jesus."""
Conan O'Brian,"Some Evangelical Christians claim that because this year’s Starbucks holiday cup doesn't have any Christmas symbols, Starbucks hates Jesus. In response, a spokesman for Starbucks said, ""We like anyone who can turn water into something we can charge $7 a cup for."""
James Corden,"After nearly seven years in office, President Obama has finally scored one of his biggest political achievements. That's right, today Barack Obama joined Facebook. "
James Corden,"The president actually signed up this morning, which means by noon, Sasha and Malia had already started ignoring friend requests from him."
James Corden,"Even Bernie Sanders is on Facebook, except he can't log in without a modem and one of those ""Free AOL"" CDs. "
James Corden,"Obama and Facebook actually have a lot in common. They both captured America's hearts and minds eight years ago, and they both seem to bring out a lot of racism in people. "
Jimmy Fallon,"I had the cutest thing happen last night. I was putting my daughter to bed, and she asked me to read her a fairy tale. I said, ""Mother Goose?"" She said, ""No, Ben Carson."" "
Jimmy Fallon,"In a recent interview, Jeb Bush said that his 91-year-old dad doesn't give him much advice and instead, just drinks martinis and gets massages all day. When asked how many martinis he drinks, the massage therapist said, ""As many as possible before I massage a 91-year-old man."""
Jimmy Fallon,"Jeb Bush also said that he's learning to toot his own horn a little better, which is good because pretty soon he's going to be the one driving his campaign bus."
Jimmy Fallon,There were no injuries this weekend after a giant sinkhole opened up in an IHOP parking lot in Mississippi and swallowed up more than a dozen cars. And that hole still ate less than most of the people in the IHOP. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"An interesting new business just opened in Colorado. It's called Gas & Grass. This is a marijuana dispensary and gas station all in one. Just in case you want to buy marijuana and then forget to buy gas, the deal is you buy pot inside the dispensary, then you get 15 cents off every gallon outside."
Jimmy Kimmel,I bet they'll sell more Slim Jims than any gas station in the world.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Every year since 1997, Starbucks releases a special red holiday cup. Usually they have snowflakes or reindeer or some kind of holiday decoration. But this year they are plain red cups. People are getting upset that Starbucks isn't celebrating Jesus' birthday. What makes people think Jesus wants to be on a Starbucks cup? There's no iced FrappuJesus; he does not want to be part of this. "
Jimmy Kimmel,To me the outrage is they start putting out holiday cups in October. Can we please get through pumpkin latte season first?
Jimmy Kimmel,"Ben Carson claims when he was a kid he tried to stab another kid but the kid's belt buckle got in the way and saved him. Some people don't believe this happened. So now he's found himself in the very unusual position of having to say, ""Yes, I did too try to stab somebody!"""
