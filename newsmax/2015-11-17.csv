James Corden,"There is a new Barbie doll called Hello Barbie that is a high-tech interactive version of the toy. 
The Hello Barbie has more than 8,000 phrases she uses to keep up conversation with you. In order for it to work, you have to speak right into her breasts. For 37 years, women have been telling me not to do that. "
James Corden,People are making a huge deal about this. But all they've done is put Siri in a Barbie doll. Big deal. I put feet and googly eyes on my iPhone and you don't see me having a press conference.
