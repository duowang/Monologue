Seth Meyers,"Everyone is talking about Donald Trump and the press release that he put out “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on."" How is that going to work? I'm not sure how the TSA would be able to test for your religion. Though I will say their pat-downs are thorough enough to determine if you're Jewish."
Seth Meyers,"Perhaps we can just casually ask people trying to enter the country, ""Hey, I'm trying to calibrate my compass. Do you know which direction Mecca is?"""

Seth Meyers,"The latest CNN/ORC Glade Plug-In Poll has her ahead of rival Bernie Sanders, 58 percent to 30 percent, with former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley registering just 2 percent — exactly the same as the milk that is more exciting than him."
Seth Meyers,"That 2 percent is up from 1.8 percent in November. That's a .2 percent surge that some are calling ""Martin O'Mentum."" "

This morning Donald Trump tweeted, ""I told you Time Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite. They picked the person who is ruining Germany."" First of all, I don't think you want to go on record saying ""I liked the old Germany better!"" "
James Corden,"I love that Trump goes, ""I told you Time Magazine would never pick me."" You don't get to brag about not winning, just because you predicted it.

Jimmy Fallon,"ABC is producing a made-for-TV musical remake of “Dirty Dancing,” and get this — it's going to be three hours long. By the end, even Baby's like, “You know what? Go ahead and put me in the corner! I've already had the time of my life. I'm exhausted.”"

Jimmy Kimmel,"Not only is Angela Merkel the first woman to be honored as individual person of the year in 20 years, but she's also the first person whose last name rhymes with “circle” to get that award. "
