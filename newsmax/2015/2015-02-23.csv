David Letterman,Thank you very much for being here. We're going to zip right through the show. We'll get you out of here in time for the rest of the Academy Awards. 
Conan O'Brian,"This will be a four-hour show, ladies and gentlemen. We're following the Oscar pattern."
Conan O'Brian,"During her Oscar acceptance speech, Patricia Arquette called for equal pay for women. Then Oprah stood up and said, ""She's right, I can't live like this. I can't take another second of this living hell."""
Conan O'Brian,"""Interstellar"" won the Oscar for best visual effects. They made it look like Matthew McConaughey understood physics. "
Conan O'Brian,"During his acceptance speech, the winner for best supporting actor, J.K. Simmons, told everyone to call their parents. I tried to call my parents but they were at the movies watching ""50 Shades of Grey."""
Seth Meyers,How many of you watched the Oscars last night? And how many of you are still watching it? 
Seth Meyers,"I don't want to say the Oscars ran long, but the best picture Oscar was awarded on ""Good Morning America."" "
Seth Meyers,The ratings for last night's Academy Awards hit a six-year low. So few people saw the Oscars that it's been nominated for an Oscar. 
Seth Meyers,"A woman in Mexico was arrested at a movie theater this weekend during ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" She was sad about being arrested, but really psyched about being handcuffed. "
Jimmy Fallon,"I'm your host, Jimmy Fallon. I would say we've got a great show tonight, but instead I put all my predictions in a briefcase that we'll open at the end of the show."
Jimmy Fallon,"At the Academy Awards last night, “Birdman” won for best picture even though many expected “Boyhood” to win. I guess voters felt like if they wanted to see people age 12 years, they could just watch last night's Oscars."
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night was the 87th annual Academy Awards. All the big designers were on display. Emma Stone's dress was designed by Elie Saab, Scarlett Johansson was done by Versace, and John Travolta was designed by Madame Tussaud."
Jimmy Fallon,A theater in Colorado accidentally played “Fifty Shades of Grey” instead of “The SpongeBob Movie” to a theater filled with children. Which explains its new name: SpongeBob NoPants.
Jimmy Kimmel,All I could think of all day yesterday while watching all of the Oscar-related shows was how much I miss football. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"I don't want to say the Oscars ran long but the kid from ""Boyhood"" just moved into a senior living facility."
Jimmy Kimmel,There really weren't any Oscar surprises last night. The only real surprise of the night was Lady Gaga wore a regular dress. They should have had Julie Andrews come out covered in lunch meat or something. 
Jimmy Kimmel,The Oscar telecast went smoothly. It helped that Bradley Cooper was in the balcony with a rifle in case any of the speeches went on too long.
