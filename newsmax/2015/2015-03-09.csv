David Letterman,"Yesterday was not only daylight saving time, but also International Women's Day. What better way to address the issue of inequality for women than giving them a day that's missing an hour. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Today is my least favorite day of the year. It's the Monday after daylight saving time starts. It throws me completely out of whack. I don't know why they do this. Even if it is necessary, which it isn't, why do we have to spring forward all at once? Can't we tippy-toe forward one minute a day over two months? "
Jimmy Kimmel,I am proud of myself. Yesterday I got in my car and looked at the clock. I'll admit it took 12 minutes to do it while I was driving but I did manage to adjust the time in my car one hour ahead. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"I still haven't adjusted the clocks in my house. I'll need four to six weeks. We can send a satellite to Mars, yet we cannot have a microwave that automatically adjusts its clock. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"For those who don't know, daylight saving time was put into practice so farmers could propose to their reality dating-show contestants an hour later. "
