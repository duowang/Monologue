Seth Meyers,"Did anybody watch the big fight this weekend? I mean, besides the two boxers? "
Seth Meyers,"The fight had so much clinching. If those guys had been hugged that much as children, they wouldn’t have grown up to be boxers."
Conan O'Brian,I had an amazing weekend. First I caught up on some sleep by watching the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight.
Conan O'Brian,"Back home in the Philippines, Manny Pacquiao is a congressman — which may explain why he didn't do much of anything the other night."
Conan O'Brian,I would have definitely paid $100 to watch someone beat up my congressman.
Conan O'Brian,A Florida man is suing a hospital for throwing his right leg away after it was amputated. The hospital says they're not worried about the lawsuit because the man does not have a leg to stand on. 
James Corden,"It was a huge weekend for sports. And of course the event everybody was talking about was the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. I mean, we're calling it a fight. To me, it seemed more like a couple of guys having a cuddle every now and then."
James Corden,"You know you're not in for a vintage fight when at the end of every round, Mayweather goes back to his corner and says, ""What is that guy's problem? He keeps trying to hit me in the face.”"
James Corden,"I'll tell you what the problem was. It was the ref. Every time they started to box, he would say, ""Whoa, guys, I'm sensing some tension here. Calm down. Someone might get hurt. All right, come on now, hug it out.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"On Saturday, Floyd Mayweather beat Manny Pacquiao to keep his undefeated record. That's actually something I have in common with Floyd Mayweather. Neither of us has ever lost a boxing match. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Actually, a lot of people were complaining about the fight, because they thought it was boring and failed to live up to the hype. Fans were hoping for the “Fight of the Century,” but got something slightly less dramatic than a fight on the “Real Housewives.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"Today Carly Fiorina announced that she is running for president. Someone else bought “CarlyFiorina.org” and posted 30,000 sad emoticons to represent all the people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard. I haven't seen that many sad, blank faces in one place since the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight."
Jimmy Fallon,"Congrats to Prince William and Kate Middleton, who welcomed a baby girl on Saturday. The royal baby weighed eight pounds — or around 12 American dollars. "
Jimmy Kimmel,I was in Las Vegas for the Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao fight. Manny was on the show recently and I asked if I could be his Justin Bieber. Bieber always walks in the ring with Floyd Mayweather. But Manny doesn't have a sexy teen idol in his camp so I offered myself.
Jimmy Kimmel,Manny Pacquiao is a congressman in the Philippines. It must be weird to see one of their congressmen fight on TV. I wish our congressmen would do that. I'd pay $100 to see John Boehner fight somebody.
Jimmy Kimmel,Tom Brady went to the Kentucky Derby in the afternoon and to the fight in Vegas that night. Even Tom Brady and Gisele need a break from time to time. That should make us feel good about ourselves. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Despite the fact that the fight was on Saturday night, the new movie ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" made $191 million over the weekend. By the way, Floyd Mayweather made $200 million — more than the movie, and he doesn't have to split it with Iron Man and The Hulk."
