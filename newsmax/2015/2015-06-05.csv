Jimmy Fallon,"It has been a crazy week in the news. Let me just tell you how weird it's gotten. It turns out the names Lincoln Chafee and Sepp Blatter are actual people, and not horses running in the Belmont Stakes. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Lincoln Chafee, former governor of Rhode Island, announced he's running for president. Before he announced he's running, his wife went on Facebook and asked his staff if they remembered his password. Because if a Facebook password is too hard to remember, the launch codes for the nukes should be a piece of cake."
Jimmy Fallon,"In an interview yesterday, Lindsey Graham discussed his foreign policy and said if people are worn out by war, quote, ""Don't vote for me."" Graham's supporters appreciate his honesty, while his opponents appreciate the sound bite they can use in their attack ads. "
