Seth Meyers,"According to a new poll, 58 percent of New Jersey residents support legalizing marijuana. I think they just want to finally have a good answer to the question, “What’s that smell?”"
Seth Meyers,It was announced today that printed physical copies of Wikipedia will soon be available for sale. Of course I’m not sure that’s true because I read it on Wikipedia.
Conan O'Brian,"At his campaign launch, Donald Trump apparently paid extras $50 to cheer for him at the rally. Trump said, ""Usually when I pay a person to like me, it's my wife."""
Conan O'Brian,"The FDA has ruled that trans fat, the main ingredient in junk food, has to be off the shelves within three years. Just as they're legalizing marijuana they're destroying junk food. Do one or do the other. You can't do them both."
James Corden,"According to The New York Times, one of the biggest doping scandals in the history of track and field is coming to light. It involves Russian athletes in the sport of racewalking — or as it's known to the billions of people who do it every day, ""hurrying up."""
James Corden,"I believe you should always play by the rules. But I understand why there might be cheating in a sport where the rules are, ""Go as fast as you can, except don't."""
James Corden,"You need just the right drugs for racewalking. What do you tell your dealer? ""Yeah, man, just a half-dose. That stuff you gave me last time was really strong. It nearly made me break into a jog."""
James Corden,It's a bad sign if you can't distinguish between a sport and a group of people rushing to the bathroom. Doping for racewalking is like robbing a bank that you know has only $2 in it.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump is running for president, which so far is everything I could have hoped for and more. He made his announcement in front of a packed crowd of supporters. But according to The Hollywood Reporter, his camp hired actors to go and then hold up signs and cheer for him. Well, Trump did say he was going to create jobs."
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump's people deny these allegations. But the casting agency that supposedly sent out the job listing refused to comment. I don't blame Trump. It's embarrassing. It's the political equivalent of paying kids to come to your birthday party.
Jimmy Kimmel,Father's Day is three days away. That’s the day you call your father and talk to him for four seconds and then he hands the phone to your mother.
Jimmy Kimmel,The world's oldest person has died. Again. Third time this year. Someone is killing the world's oldest people and we do nothing about it.
