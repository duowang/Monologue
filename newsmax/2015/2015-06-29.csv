Jimmy Kimmel,"The Supreme Court has ended same-sex marriage bans. This is going to totally ruin being gay. I will explain. I live in a gay neighborhood and these people have a lot of fun. The reason is because there is no pressure to settle down. It's illegal. Say you're dating a guy. He says, Why can't we get married? You say, Well, same reason we can't rob a bank. "
Jimmy Kimmel,But now that reason is gone. Which means now you go home and your parents and friends will do that thing where they put you on the spot. Society will push you and push you and eventually you'll give in. This is what happened to George Clooney. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"And then once you do give in, guess what? Instead of the fun parades with the drinks and the half-naked dancer guys, the only parades you will be going to are the ones with the big inflatable Snoopy. He'll be looking at you as if to say, ""What the hell did you do?"" "
Jimmy Kimmel,"All the gay fun will be over. Remember when the word meant happy? It doesn't anymore, thanks to the Supreme Court. "
Jimmy Kimmel,The only difference between gay marriage and straight marriage is no one complains when you leave the toilet seat up.
