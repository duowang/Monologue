Conan O'Brian,Presidential candidate Donald Trump had a meeting with Ted Cruz. He said he does not know why he agreed to fly to New York to meet Ted Cruz and then he promised to bring that kind of leadership to the Oval Office.
Conan O'Brian,There is now footage of the drug kingpin El Chapo changing his shoes right before his escape. Apparently authorities didn't notice El Chapo was lacing up a pair of Nike Tunnel Runners. It's a special brand they have. 
Conan O'Brian,"That El Chapo is quite a character. A photo surfaced of El Chapo drinking a beer and flying a plane. Sounds like we have a new ""Most interesting man in the world."""
James Corden,"A Texas couple's car was stolen a month ago. Yesterday it was found and it had been upgraded. There was a new drive shaft, three new wheels, and 30 bags of meth in it. You know you're high on meth when you think a car has only three wheels."
James Corden,"That is what happens when someone who sells meth steals your car. When someone who sells weed steals your car, it comes back full of candy wrappers and two tickets to the Grateful Dead reunion."
James Corden,"The problem with meth stories is once you've had one, all you want to do is have another. It's a slippery slope. But we can do one more because if we do it together we're doing it for fun. It's only if you're doing it alone that it becomes a problem, right?"
James Corden,A man in Colorado was driving with a cousin who refused to get out of the car. So he called the police and they found her in the car along with 16 pounds of meth. Isn't the first rule of having 16 pounds of meth in your car to never call the police?
James Corden,"Sixteen pounds of meth. To put that in perspective, that's how much meth you would have to smoke to vote for Donald Trump. "
Jimmy Fallon,Some bad news for Donald Trump. The controversial remarks he’s made since he began his presidential campaign have cost his brand as much as $80 million. You can tell things are rough for Trump because today he had to wipe his mouth with a napkin instead of a 20. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Shepard Fairey, the street artist responsible for President Obama’s “Hope” poster, is now facing vandalism charges in Detroit. It's pretty serious. Detroit officials say the artist's spray paint caused over $9,000 worth of improvements."
Jimmy Fallon,"With more and more states legalizing marijuana, companies are lining up to create the first marijuana breathalyzer. Officials say the toughest part is getting stoners to stop trying to inhale off the breathalyzer. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Kim Kardashian went on Shaquille O'Neal's podcast this week and said she would not name her son a direction because, quote, ""North is the best."" Interesting. I didn't realize that Shaq had a podcast. "
Seth Meyers," After severing ties with Donald Trump, NBC is reportedly in talks with comedian George Lopez to take over ""Celebrity Apprentice."" So Trump’s greatest nightmare came true. A Hispanic guy took his job. "
Seth Meyers," Now that some economic sanctions are being lifted, Iranian citizens are apparently clamoring for Western products like iPhones. We should have just sent them iPhones in the first place. Then they’d never get any work done on a nuclear weapon. "
Seth Meyers, President Obama said yesterday that education is the key to reducing the prison population. Though apparently power tools also work.
