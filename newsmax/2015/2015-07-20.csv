Seth Meyers,"A couple who got married in Illinois on Friday has the last names Burger and King. Which makes sense because in a few years most of their conversations will end with “Fine, have it your way!”"
Seth Meyers,"Rick Perry said this weekend that he believes Boy Scouts would be “better off if they didn’t have openly gay scoutmasters.” Man, between the Boy Scouts and gay marriage, Republicans really don’t want gays tying the knot."
Seth Meyers,Rachel Dolezal gave an interview to Vanity Fair where she continued to claim she is black. Even though the whitest thing you can do is give an interview to Vanity Fair.
Seth Meyers,"The U.S. won the International Math Olympiad. If you don’t think Americans can compete with Asia in math, maybe you should talk to some of the members of the American team, like Shyam Narayanan, Yang Liu, and Allen Liu. And their coach, Po-Shen Loh."
James Corden,A couple named Joel Burger and Ashley King were married this weekend. It was the Burger-King wedding. 
James Corden,"Joel Burger and Ashley King must really want to be with each other because they're willing to put up with every single person they meet thinking they're making a Burger King joke like they're hearing it for the first time.

James Corden,Ashley Madison is a dating service for married people looking to have an affair. It's a website that I definitely only heard about for the first time this morning and 100 percent knew nothing about before.
James Corden,"Well, Ashley Madison was hacked today and the hacker has vowed to leak all 35 million users' identities and information. This is the day you want if you're a divorce lawyer. It's like Christmas. It's also Christmas for kids who want to have two Christmases."
Jimmy Fallon,"Donald Trump got in some trouble for saying that John McCain is not a war hero, and said, “I like people that weren’t captured.” Not good. In fact, Trump's people are telling him to lay low for a while until this all combs over."
Jimmy Fallon,"Rick Perry said Donald Trump is unfit to be president and called for him to immediately withdraw from the race. Then he said, “And that’s coming from ME!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Perry actually said Trump is a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense who is unfit to be president. Then Perry took off his glasses and said, ""Whoa! I think these things are magic!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"The dating website AshleyMadison.com, which is a site where married people go to find someone to have an affair with, was hacked yesterday and now the hackers are threatening to release information about its users. This is one way to cut down on the number of people running for president."
Jimmy Kimmel,"On Saturday Donald Trump had some unkind words for Arizona Senator John McCain. Can you imagine being tortured 5 1/2 years in a Vietnamese prison camp, and then a man whose greatest war-time accomplishment was brokering a peace treaty on ""Celebrity Apprentice"" between Gary Busey and Meat Loaf belittles you and calls you a loser?"
Jimmy Kimmel,The closest Trump ever got to battle was his fight with Rosie O'Donnell.
Jimmy Kimmel,Donald Trump had a very good reason for not fighting in the Vietnam War. He had student deferments and a medical deferment because of his feet. He had a bone spur.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Maybe we should enter Donald Trump in a surf competition. Even if he doesn't get eaten by a shark it would be worth it to see him with his hair wet, right?"
