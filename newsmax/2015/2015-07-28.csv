Seth Meyers,"The season finale of ""The Bachelorette"" was last night. And Nick was the big winner because Kaitlyn chose Shawn. I'm not sure that's the best way to tell the story how you met your fiancée. ""I won her on a game show, it came down to two men and I won her."""
Seth Meyers,"A New York man was arrested Friday for driving an ice cream truck intoxicated wearing only underwear and yelling at children.  So on the down side, he was arrested. But, on the up side, he is the Republican front-runner."
Seth Meyers,"A new book by Dr. Seuss came out today called ""What Pet Should I get."" He was inspired to write it when his wife said, “I want a baby.” "
Seth Meyers,"The Orange County Fair in California is going on now, and features deep-fried Slim-Fast bars. It's perfect if you haven't decided if you want to be fat or not. The fair also features deep-fried pizza, deep-fried birthday cake, and deep-fried pickles stuffed with peanut butter."
Seth Meyers,"Not featured at the Orange County Fair: oranges. Not a single, solitary orange."
James Corden,"Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak were a part of a group of scientists that issued a warning to all of humanity that recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence will one day lead to killer robots. Just to be clear, when I say killer robots, I don't mean like ""killer robots, dude."" I mean robots that will kill you. "
James Corden,"First the robots take all the auto industry jobs. Now they're putting good, honest, hard-working assassins out of work. Where does it end?"
James Corden,"Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk issuing a warning I can understand, but Apple founder Steve Wozniak? This is the guy I'm going listen to about the future? The dude who sold his Apple stock in 1985?"
James Corden,"The killer robots can't be coming that soon. Like, in the movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" we were supposed to be living on the moon in the year 2001. It's 2015 and we’re not even living in Detroit. "
James Corden,"Before we start thinking about a robot future, let's get today right. We don't even have free Wi-Fi when we have signs that say free Wi-Fi."
James Corden,It was announced that they are developing the very first invisible car. Why would anyone want that? An invisible car is just going to be an excuse people use when they try to walk through the Jack-in-the-Box drive-thru.
Jimmy Fallon,"I saw that Donald Trump is selling his penthouse suite at the Trump Park Avenue building here in New York City for $21 million.  When asked why he’s selling it now, Trump said ""Hey, Americans seem to be buying everything else I'm selling, so why not strike while the iron's hot.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"Three of Donald Trump’s kids have come forward to defend him, and called him “an incredible dad and role model.” Donald was so moved that he wrote one of them back into his will. “I’m not gonna tell you which one . . . it’s Donald Jr.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"In several speeches and interviews, Donald Trump has brought up his book “The Art of the Deal,” and said that Obama would have negotiated a better deal with Iran if he had read it. It got even more awkward for Obama when Iran was like, “It worked for us — you guys got screwed!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night was the big season finale of “The Bachelorette,” and for the second season in a row, Nick Viall made it to the final two, only to wind up losing. I dunno, man. If you lose “The Bachelorette” twice in a row, there must be something really, really RIGHT with you."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yesterday, the U.S. Olympic Committee announced they're withdrawing Boston's bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games.  We have not been able to get a majority of the citizens of Boston to support hosting the 2024 Olympic Games. The only thing they support is throwing beer bottles at Yankees fans."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The USOC has to come up with another city from the United States to bid against Paris, Rome, and Toronto, and most people think that city will be Los Angeles — which is exciting. The summer Olympics could bring some much-needed traffic to the L.A. area."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Hey, Boston, stop sending us the crap you don't want. First Matt Damon, now this. We've had enough."
