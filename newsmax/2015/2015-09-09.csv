Seth Meyers,"During yesterday’s rally supporting her opposition to same-sex marriage, embattled county clerk Kim Davis and her husband posed for photos with prominent Republicans. She apparently met her husband in a John Steinbeck novel."
Seth Meyers,"Justin Bieber's new song “What Do You Mean?” is his first-ever Billboard number 1 single. Bieber wrote the song in response to the question, “Does the defendant understand the charges before him?” "
Seth Meyers,"A man in Northern Ireland has been sentenced to four months in jail after he repeatedly got drunk and called emergency services while pretending to be rapper Nicki Minaj. Wow, nobody’s gotten in this much trouble for pretending to be Nicki Minaj since Iggy Azalea."
Stephen Colbert,"These days one of the most important factors in a successful campaign is the online merchandise store, where you can buy candidate-themed T-shirts, mugs, and trucker caps. Lots of great gift ideas for everyone you know named Rand. "
Stephen Colbert,It's important for candidates to set themselves apart with one-of-a-kind items like Hillary Clinton’s “Chillary” drink koozie. It's her favorite way to keep a beverage cold unless polling indicates a more popular cooling method.
Stephen Colbert,Bernie Sanders has a great coffee mug that says “Feel the Bern.” Which Senator Sanders was specifically told by H.R. not to say to his interns.
Stephen Colbert,Even billionaire Donald Trump is funding his campaign with a store. Which is great because where else could you find something with his name on it?
Stephen Colbert,"You're not just buying useless crap, you're doing your patriotic duty to buy useless crap. As Rand Paul says of his own online merchandise, “Thomas Jefferson would be proud.” So much better than Rand's original slogan, “Impress a slaveholder!” "
James Corden,"Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who was held in contempt of court for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses, has been released after four harrowing nights in jail. It would have just been three nights, except the jail offices were closed for Labor Day — which is ironic because that's the holiday where we celebrate people who do their jobs."
James Corden,"Kim Davis says that issuing marriage licenses to gay people violates her religious beliefs. The state of Kentucky says that it's her job. Gay people in Kentucky say, “Why the hell am I living in Kentucky?”"
James Corden,"Davis was only in jail for four nights. To put that in perspective, Nelson Mandela was in prison for 27 years and he walked out calmly wearing a suit. Kim Davis was in jail for four nights and she came out like she was about to fight Manny Pacquiao. "
Jimmy Fallon,"According to a New York Times report, Hillary Clinton's campaign is trying to put the whole email scandal behind her. They say they want to start bringing humor and spontaneity to her campaign. And nothing says spontaneity like announcing you're about to be spontaneous.  “Here comes the spontaneity in 3, 2, 1 ... Boo!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Everyone’s still talking about Donald Trump. Even Tom Brady. In an interview yesterday, Brady said that Donald Trump occasionally calls him up to give “motivational speeches.” I think we know the REAL reason Tom Brady destroyed his cellphone."
Jimmy Fallon,Today Apple held their big event in San Francisco. And they announced their extra-large iPad Pro which features a screen that measures over 12 inches. They say it's the best way yet for people to ruin concerts.
Jimmy Fallon,Toyota filed a patent this weekend for a wing system that could be an attempt to make a flying Prius. As opposed to what USUALLY creates a flying Prius: a strong gust of wind.
Jimmy Kimmel,"There was another big announcement from Apple today — a number of exciting new products for you to lose in a cab on the way to the airport.
These Apple announcements are always interesting to watch primarily because the Apple marketing people are so easily amazed.  “Your photos will look amazing on it.” “It's an amazing experience.” “This is an amazing display.” “Inside it is something even more amazing.” “You can see they're amazingly thin.” … Siri, what are synonyms for the word amazing?
