Conan O'Brian,There was a moment from last night's debate that went viral. It was Donald Trump's very awkward attempt to high-five fellow [candidate] Ben Carson.

It was the only preparation he did for the debate.

Jimmy Kimmel,"The most awkward handshake came courtesy of Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson. It starts a as a high-five, then Dr. Carson comes in low. Then it turns into a tug of war. That wasn't slow motion by the way. That's the speed at which Ben Carson actually moves."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Ben Carson did not make a particularly strong impression last night. Ben Carson, to me, comes off like a guy who grabbed the wrong drink at Bill Cosby's house. "
