Seth Meyers,"New York City plans to deploy an extra 6,000 police officers to help guard Pope Francis during his visit. It’ll be the most protection a Catholic has ever used."
Seth Meyers,"President Obama this morning gave Pope Francis a sculpture of an ascending dove made with pieces of the Statue of Liberty and wood taken from the White House lawn, as well as a key to the house of the first American-born saint.  The Pope then said, “Oh, I didn’t get you anything” and quietly put a $40 Starbucks gift card back in his pocket."
Seth Meyers,"A new study has found that 8 percent of Americans sleep naked. Unfortunately, the study was conducted on the F train."
Seth Meyers,A new study suggests that people who fidget at their desks are less likely to die than those who sit still. Although people who fidget at their desks are more likely to die because the person next to them “had to make it stop.”
Conan O'Brian,It's Yom Kippur today. Jews all over the country honored the day by staying home and watching the Pope on television. 
Conan O'Brian,"The Pope's totally like, “I'm going there on Yom Kippur. That will show them.”"
Conan O'Brian,"The Pope is at the White House today, the band played the Vatican's national anthem. The Vatican has a national anthem, isn't that crazy? Apparently it's Katy Perry's ""Roar."""
Conan O'Brian,"On Saturday, the Pope will attend an event hosted by Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg said, ""I'm wicked pumped to meet the [bleep] Pope. Somebody get the Pope a shot."""
James Corden,"Pope Francis has landed in the United States for a historic five-day visit to D.C., New York City, and Philadelphia. Whether you're Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or Hindu, you have to be in awe of the amount of traffic this is going to create."
James Corden,"If you wanted to see the Pope during his visit, best of luck to you. He's appearing in Central Park on Friday, but tickets ran out so quickly that they're now being scalped for upwards of $1,500 apiece. That is a lot to pay for someone who can't sing or play guitar."
James Corden,"It's ironic people are scalping tickets for so much when the Pope has been saying that Americans worship money, and that capitalism is destroying our souls."
James Corden,"Twitter has created a bunch of special hashtags to honor the Pope, proving once and for all that Twitter doesn't really know the meaning of the word ""honor."" "
James Corden,"Twitter created #Popeinus. #Popeindc. #Popeinnyc, and #Popeinphilly. But just in case the Pope decides to extend his trip, we've created a few hashtags of our own. If he should choose to come visit us here, we have got #Popeinla, #Popeinorlando, #Popeinseattle — where he ordered a pope-kin spice latte!"
Jimmy Fallon,"Today is the first day of fall! You can tell it's getting colder, ’cuz today I saw a rat on the subway trying to carry a pumpkin spice latte."
Jimmy Fallon,"The big story right now is Pope Francis visiting the U.S., and I saw that yesterday, the Pope's plane couldn't land right away because he arrived earlier than planned. That's right, the Pope's flight was early. So I guess he really CAN perform miracles!"
Jimmy Fallon,"Chris Christie recently ordered the leader of the New Jersey National Guard to lose weight within the next 90 days. And if he doesn't, Christie will eat him. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday, a federal judge ruled that the ""Happy Birthday"" song is now public domain, so no one has to pay to use it in movies or TV anymore. Not to be confused with the ""Happy Birthday"" songs in restaurants, which people WOULD pay to never hear again. "
Jimmy Fallon,"The Dalai Lama raised some eyebrows during a recent interview when he said that if a future Dalai Lama is female, she would have to be very attractive, otherwise there's “not much use.” Man, I knew the Dalai Lama believed in reincarnation, but I never realized he'd come back as Donald Trump."
Jimmy Kimmel,It's the first day of autumn but the only way to tell what season it is in L.A. is by which flavored syrup Starbucks is adding to their coffee. If it's pumpkin spice you know summer must be done.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Pope Francis is here. He got in yesterday. He didn't do anything last night, they want him to rest for his hectic schedule the next few days. He did get some rest — much of it during his welcoming ceremony on the south lawn of the White House. That's one thing about being Pope — nobody knows when you're sleeping or when you're praying."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Pope addressed about 11,000 people at the welcoming event. He spoke about climate change. He said it's a problem that ""can no longer be left to a future generation."" Global warming is a very important issue for the Pope because as you know he has to wear a floor-length, long-sleeved gown to work every day and it's hot. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Chris Christie has reportedly ordered the commander of the state National Guard to lose weight. That is how you put the hippo in hypocrite.
Jimmy Kimmel,Christie had a secret lap band surgery two years ago. Apparently the surgery was even a secret to his stomach. He had a band put around his stomach. And that band by the way? Bon Jovi. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yogi Berra, Hall of Fame catcher and manager for the Yankees and Mets, passed away yesterday, 90 years old, a great catcher and a great character. He had so many classic quotes. Yogi Berra is the guy who said, ""90 percent of the game is half mental."" He also said, ""It's deja vu all over again,"" and ""It ain't over till it's over."" He was known as much for screwing up metaphors as he was for baseball. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"I can't help but feel like it makes perfect sense that this is how the Associated Press reported his death today: ""New York Yankees catcher Yogi Bear has died. Went to that great pick-a-nick basket in the sky."""
