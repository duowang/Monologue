James Corden,"The baseball playoffs start this week, and last week there was a baseball game in Arizona where some girls in the stands were taking so many selfies, it caught the attention of the commentators.

James Corden,"More people have died taking selfies than have been killed by sharks. It is tragic, not only because you're dead, but because you'll never be able to see how many “likes” that picture got. "
