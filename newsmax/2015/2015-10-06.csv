James Corden,There's been a lot of discussion lately about comfort animals — they provide emotional support to people who are dealing with anxiety. It's like medical marijuana on a leash. 
James Corden,"A few months ago, a woman on a US Airways flight was famously kicked off the plane when her emotional support pig refused to stop squealing and defecated in the cabin. Yeah, honestly, pigs can fly."
James Corden,"The truth is, they already make a pig that comforts you. It's called bacon."
James Corden,"According to The New York Times, universities are receiving requests for guinea pigs, ferrets, lizards, and some of these students are even bringing tarantulas as comfort animals. Here's a rule that we should all follow: You can't have a comfort animal that is also a Halloween decoration."
James Corden,Where is this going to end? I'll tell you. It never ends because eventually you're going to need a comfort hawk to feel at ease around your roommate’s comfort tarantula. 
Conan O'Brian,"Yesterday Hillary Clinton criticized Donald Trump during an interview on Telemundo. Clinton knew if there was one place she could criticize Trump without him finding out about it, it's on Telemundo. "
Conan O'Brian,It's being reported that Donald Trump is mentioned on social media seven times more often than any other Republican candidate. And that's just by Donald Trump. 
Conan O'Brian,"A controversial 1,200-year-old document has been found that shows evidence that Jesus was married. I don't believe it. What married guy gets to spend all his free time with his 12 buddies? "
Conan O'Brian,Bud Light has created a new device that alerts you when the beer supply in your fridge is running low. The device is known as your roommate Chad. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"General Mills is recalling a number of Cheerios products because some boxes that were labeled gluten-free were not gluten-free. As a result, 1.8 million boxes of Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios are being removed from the shelves at stores. This sounds to me like the work of that evil dictator, Vladimir Gluten. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"This does affect those people who are allergic to gluten and also those who pretend to be allergic to gluten. When someone's in a bad mood now, just ask, “Who put gluten in your Cheerios?” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"It's Fashion Week in Paris and all of the latest fashions are on display. The new trend that's getting a lot of attention is something called human backpacks. This is the work of a designer named Rick Owens. It's people wearing other people. Gives a whole new meaning to the question, ""Who are you wearing?"""
Jimmy Fallon,"Congrats to Barack and Michelle Obama, who just celebrated their 23rd wedding anniversary. I guess that explains why this morning, Barack was seen running toward the Rose Garden with a vase and a pair of scissors. “Of course I remembered!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Everybody’s still talking about Donald Trump. A recent poll had voters describe Trump in one word, and a lot of them used the words “idiot,” “buffoon,” “clown,” and “jerk.” And those are the people voting for Trump."
Jimmy Fallon,"Of course, they also used other words, like “Still,” “better,” “than” and “Jeb.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Martin O’Malley, ex-governor of Maryland, is running for president. He’s at 2 percent in the polls. He’s been in the race eight months, and he’s only tied with low-fat milk. "
Jimmy Fallon,A lot of people think that when the Republican field clears it will come down to Jeb Bush and Donald Trump. Kind of like the race between the tortoise and the bad hair.
Jimmy Fallon,"Republicans say the economy is bad. So bad, in New York over on Park Avenue, I saw a woman with real breasts and a fake Gucci bag. "
Stephen Colbert,"McDonald's began serving breakfast all day long. I hope you're with a loved one right now. I learned this alone. It's the sort of news that changes a man. The only reason I ever got up before 10:30 a.m. was to make it to the McDonald's breakfast deadline. If I didn't make it in time, what then? "
Stephen Colbert,"I went out and saw the number one movie in America this weekend, ""The Martian."" It's the sci-fi thriller that takes place in the near future where — here's the twist — NASA has a budget. "
Stephen Colbert,I wasn't alone in loving it. It pulled in $100 million in its opening weekend. And $2 million of that was just from me buying popcorn and Junior Mints. 
Stephen Colbert,"""The Martian"" is expected to do particularly well when it launches in China. … This movie is a natural match for China. Because not only is the planet Mars red, I believe it has more oxygen than Beijing."
Seth Meyers,"Dr. Ben Carson hosted a Facebook Q&A; last night, and said the loss of gun rights is more devastating than seeing people die from gun violence. So if Ben Carson is your doctor, definitely get a second opinion."
