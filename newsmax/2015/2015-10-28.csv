James Corden,"Earlier this week Donald received the endorsement of one of America's great political minds. Remember, Mike Tyson once bit a man's ear off on national television — and endorsing Donald Trump is the craziest thing he has ever done. "
James Corden,The only acceptable time to take advice from a man with a face tattoo is if you're wondering how to hide a body.
James Corden,"But Tyson isn't the only celebrity endorsing Trump. He's also been endorsed by Kirstie Alley, Gary Busey, Dennis Rodman, and Hulk Hogan, which sounds like a season of ""Celebrity Apprentice."" "
James Corden,"Republican candidate Mike Huckabee has earned endorsements from several members of the Duggar family. And that is a smart political move, since nearly 40 percent of Republican voters are actually members of the Duggar family. "
James Corden,"Some candidates, like Democratic candidate Martin O'Malley, are having trouble getting celebrities on their bandwagon. We here at ""The Late Late Show"" are open to supporting you, Martin O'Malley, but first we have a couple questions. Question 1: Who are you? Question 2 . . . That is really the only question we have. "
James Corden,"Bernie Sanders has received an endorsement from Justin Long, the actor who famously played a ""Mac"" in those old Apple commercials. The endorsement meant so much to Bernie, he's thinking of switching over to a Mac from his current computer, a yellow legal pad. "
Conan O'Brian,"On Monday, former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson endorsed Donald Trump. Tyson joins Trump’s biggest group of supporters: ""People Who Have Been Hit in the Head a Lot."""
Conan O'Brian,"Tonight’s Republican debate took place in Colorado, where marijuana is legal. Which explains why every single question from the audience was, ""Where am I?"""
Conan O'Brian,A new study just came out that shows decreasing the amount of sugar in obese children's diet improves their health within 10 days. The study was conducted by a bunch of jerks trying to ruin Halloween.
Conan O'Brian,"Tonight is game two of the World Series. They might have to cancel it, though — apparently they’re still playing game one."
Conan O'Brian,"The math skills of American students have dropped for the first time since 1990. Or as American math students put it, ""Since eight years ago."""

Jimmy Kimmel,"Did you see that baseball game last night? 14 innings. It was the second-longest game in World Series history, it was brutal. I'm exhausted. My wife said to me this morning, “You realize you're exhausted from watching other men play sports?”"
Jimmy Kimmel,That game last night was longer than a voice mail from your mother. 
Jimmy Kimmel,There are a million people in New York and Kansas City sleeping on their desks today. A baseball game should never be longer than the Ken Burns documentary about baseball.

Jimmy Kimmel,"The two front-runners: Ben Carson, who doesn't believe in evolution; and Donald Trump, who kind of proves his point. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yesterday, Donald Trump told the crowd in Iowa, ""I am a great Christian."" If you have to tell people you're a great Christian, you might not be a great Christian. Jesus said it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. Which is why Donald Trump is now currently working on plans to build an enormous needle.

I don't know what happened yet because we taped this at 5:30, but I am super excited about the brand new Republican front-runner, retired neurosurgeon and current tired person Ben Carson. "
Stephen Colbert,"It's been a great time for him. This surgeon is surging in the polls, 26 percent, ahead of Donald Trump's 22 percent. The other 52 percent, of course, is going to the other 52 candidates. "
Stephen Colbert,"Carson's strongest support comes from evangelical Christians, a group that Donald Trump has had real trouble with, evidently. People who read the Bible just don't want to follow someone who looks that much like a golden calf. "
Stephen Colbert,"I haven't been able to watch tonight's Republican debate yet, but I'm excited to see the face-off between the party's biggest opponents: Carson and staying awake. "
