James Corden,"We all know being an adult is hard. When you were a kid, having your mom around made things a lot easier. Which is why one woman in Brooklyn is offering her services for $40 an hour as a rent-a-mom — sewing buttons on your shirts, baking your favorite dessert, and calling you at 6 a.m. on a Saturday because she can't remember how to set the DVR."
James Corden,"It's got to be uncomfortable when your real mom notices all your shirts are ironed and your bed is made and goes, ""Wait a minute — have you been seeing other moms?"" "
James Corden,"You know somewhere out there, a prostitute is watching this, saying, ""Wait a second, you're telling me I could just be folding shirts?"" "
James Corden,"If renting a mom isn't for you, but you still want to feel like a kid again, don't worry because someone in Brooklyn is offering enrollment in a preschool for adults. "
James Corden,"Why is it that any time you have ""Adult"" before something, it immediately becomes creepy or sad or both? Think about it. Adult bookstore. Adult diapers. Adult Michael Jackson.

Jimmy Kimmel,Walmart announced this Black Friday they're doing away with their highly sought-after and fought-over doorbuster deals. I guess this is a good thing. But I feel like as a society we might need these doorbuster deals. One night a year we get out all our aggression by savagely beating our fellow shoppers.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Like the movie ""The Purge"" — now Walmart's taking the fun out of it just because we trampled a few of their elderly greeters.  "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Walmart will be open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving this year, as will most of the major retailers. And let's be honest, the truth is we don't really want to shop on Thanksgiving. We just want an excuse to get away from our families immediately after the pie. "

"

Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump said in a new interview, ""We started off with 17 and one by one they're disappearing. It's a beautiful thing to watch as they go out."" Which begs the question, have we actually just been watching ""The Apprentice"" this whole time? "
Seth Meyers,"The next Democratic debate is being held this Saturday in Des Moines, Iowa, and will be broadcast by CBS News. And if that doesn't do the job, try Ambien. "
