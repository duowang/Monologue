Jimmy Fallon,Tomorrow night is the second Democratic debate! It's the perfect way to spend a Saturday night if you're single. And it's raining. And every movie theater is closed. And you only get one channel.
Jimmy Fallon,"This time, the debate will feature just three candidates: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley. Or as viewers call them, “Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Bathroom Break.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Bernie Sanders got an endorsement from the American Postal Workers Union. Well, Bernie Sanders' neighbor got the endorsement, but it was meant for Bernie. He’ll get it eventually."
Jimmy Fallon,"I read about a pub in England that has 15 cats that just walk around, so you can play with them while you drink beer. Customers said it's really fun and cozy, while the bar's owner…has been dead upstairs for months. "
Stephen Colbert,"Check your calendars, Thanksgiving is just around the corner. I'm a little worried because there is a turkey shortage this year. There is an outbreak of deadly avian flu that killed eight million turkey. It's so sad to see so many turkeys dying in a way that doesn't render them delicious. "
Stephen Colbert,"That’s not the only thing the avian flu has cost us this fall because there's an egg shortage too, which has caused egg prices to rise 50 percent this year. It's gotten so bad that 7-Eleven has begun using eggless mayo in their food, which is a shocker. I always assumed 7-Eleven used foodless food in their food."
Stephen Colbert,"In the face of this egg crisis, we shall not crack. As a country, we must scramble and whisk it all because it won't be over easy."
Stephen Colbert,"Lately, Trump has been pretty cranky about losing his lead in the polls over retired neurosurgeon and ""Guy who sits next to you in an otherwise empty theater,"" Ben Carson. Evidently, people have been looking at Trump and thinking, ""Maybe we shouldn't elect a man who shouts crazy things. Maybe we should elect a man who whispers crazy things."" "
