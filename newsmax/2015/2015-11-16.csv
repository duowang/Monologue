Seth Meyers,"People are trying to find any way they can to show support, however small, to the people of France. For instance, Twitter was deluged with statements of support — from #Prayforparis to messages like ""My wife and I are watching #Ratatouille in support of what is happening in Paris."""
Seth Meyers,"Is “Ratatouille” a French film? No. Is it a valid expression? Absolutely. So go drink a bottle of Bordeaux, eat a croissant at Au Bon Pain, slap on a beret and smoke a cigarette, and go eat some French fries."
Seth Meyers,"To destroy ISIS, President Hollande has said that he will form a big unified coalition. But today President Obama said it would be a mistake for the U.S. to send troops to Syria. So the international community agrees on two things. One, the only way to wipe out ISIS is to send in ground troops. And two: “Not it!” "
James Corden,"During a moment of silence at the Packers game, one very misguided fan yelled out ""Muslims suck."" Which is obviously awful. This guy probably thought he had everyone's support when he yelled it out, but you just know as soon as he said it, he looked around and was like, ""Oh no."""
James Corden,"If you're thinking of yelling something out during a moment of silence, here's what you can do to curb that urge. Hold your breath, count to 10, and then just keep holding your breath forever. "

Jimmy Fallon,"Data from social media and Google showed that Bernie Sanders was the most talked about of the three Democratic candidates after the debate. Bernie came in first, Hillary came in second, — and somehow Martin O'Malley came in fourth."
Jimmy Fallon,"The man who invented ibuprofen said that he knew it worked when he tested some out to cure a hangover before giving an important speech. While the man who invented Viagra unfortunately also tested it out before giving a wedding toast. “I COULDN’T be more excited for you guys! I just caught the bouquet!"""
Jimmy Kimmel,"It occurred to me that football is essentially a very organized version of a game I play with my 16-month-old daughter called ""I'm going to get you."""

Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump is out in front of the pack again. According to a new Reuters poll he's in first place among likely Republican voters with 42 percent. Ben Carson is in second with just under 25 percent. Only 4 percent now say they would support Jeb Bush. That number dropped to 2 percent when the pollster asked, ""Really?"""
Jimmy Kimmel,"I think Donald Trump will drop out once he finds out how much money the president actually makes. I think he pays his hair flap engineer more than $400,000 a year."
