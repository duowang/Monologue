James Corden,"Huge news for the city of Los Angeles, because after 21 years, the city is finally getting a football team. The Rams are moving back to L.A. — so finally another thing for the people of Los Angeles to pretend to care about. "
James Corden,"I have lived in Los Angeles for one year, and in that time Los Angeles has regained an NFL team, it started raining again after three years of drought, and they opened the city's first Dunkin' Donuts. Now look, I can't take credit for all of those, but I'm definitely taking credit for that Dunkin' Donuts. That was all me. "

Jimmy Kimmel,"President Obama gave his final State of the Union address last night. It was the president's shortest State of the Union address, clocking in at 58:49. Mine would have been however long it takes to say, ""You're on your own, suckers."""
Jimmy Kimmel,"If you're a Republican you don't want to get caught agreeing with anything Obama says because it could ruin your political career, so you have to sit there and make a face like you're witnessing your family getting eaten by coyotes through the whole thing."
