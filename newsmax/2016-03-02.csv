James Corden,The biggest story yesterday wasn't about Trump or Clinton victories. It was Chris Christie's face during Donald Trump's victory speech. He looks like he had amnesia for a week and just remembered who Donald Trump was.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Chris Christie flew all the way to Florida to stand behind Donald Trump supporting him. Throughout the speech, he looks genuinely miserable. He looks like he saw the bottom of a supposedly bottomless pasta bowl at Olive Garden. He looks as though someone just told him butterscotch causes cancer. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Dr. Ben Carson didn't win any states last night, but don't tell him. He slept through the whole thing. He released a statement today that he does not see a path forward to the presidency and will skip the debate tomorrow night. Was he at the last one?"
