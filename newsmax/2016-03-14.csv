Seth Meyers,"Chris Christie interviewed Donald Trump today at a rally in North Carolina. During the interview, Christie asked Trump to talk about what kind of father he's been, to which Trump replied, ""A creepy one.""

Seth Meyers,"
When endorsing Donald Trump for president last week, Dr. Ben Carson said that there are two different Trumps. I don't know, Ben. That might just be a side effect of the NyQuil. 

"
Seth Meyers,North Korea claimed yesterday that they could wipe out Manhattan with one of their hydrogen bombs. Though I find it hard to believe that this guy would willingly destroy that many restaurants. 
Seth Meyers,The latest polls show Gov. John Kasich holds a small lead over Donald Trump in his home state of Ohio. Whereas everything Donald Trump holds looks huge because of his tiny baby hands. 
Seth Meyers,A new restaurant has opened in Los Angeles that creates special dinners based on the city's most notorious murders and crimes. So you have to be careful if you order an O.J. with your breakfast. 
Seth Meyers,"It's Daylight Savings Time. It's my least favorite holiday. For one thing, the parade is horrible. At least I assume it is. I always miss it because I'm an hour late for everything. "
Seth Meyers,"Americans are working longer hours, and the only break most of us get is a little extra sleep on the weekends. Which I use to stress-dream about work! Then one day a year, the government comes in under cover of darkness and steals a precious hour of sleep from us. "
Seth Meyers,"So I'm over it. Especially the phrase ""Spring Forward.” Don't try to make it sound fun. I'm not ""Leaping"" into the future! I'm barely hoisting myself out of bed and it’s dangerous.  "
Seth Meyers,"Studies have found there's an increase in auto accidents the Monday after Daylight Savings. Even our cars are tired. 

"
Seth Meyers,"Why does it have to happen on the weekend? Why can't they do it on a Wednesday at 4:00? ""Hey look, now it's 5:00. Time to go home!"" 

"
James Corden,"This weekend was Daylight Savings Time and we all lost an hour of our lives. Plus, I watched the Democratic debate so I actually lost three hours of my life. "
James Corden,"But we're not just tired today, we're also distracted because the NCAA College Basketball Championship bracket is set. Yes, it's time for March Madness! Or as Kanye West calls it, March."
James Corden,"This is how popular March Madness is: Doctors have found a sudden rise in vasectomies coincides with the start of the NCAA tournament. Apparently, guys are scheduling their vasectomies for the beginning of the tournament so that they can have four days of rest and not miss any of the games. "
James Corden,"
There's an easier way to get four days off to watch basketball. You can just say you got a vasectomy, you don't actually have to do it! Your boss isn't going to ask you, “OK Larry, drop your pants. We both know you were out of vacation days."" 
"
James Corden,"In December you're telling people you're getting a vasectomy, and then your buddy Carl is going, ""No, man, schedule it for March. You get four days off to watch basketball."" And you're like, ""Great idea."" Then you get your wife pregnant in January and you're like, ""Damn it, Carl!"" "
James Corden,"
A vasectomy is not something you want to get at the busiest time of the year. It's not an iPhone. It's an unnecessary surgery on the most delicate part of your body. You know if they screw it up, there's no amount of basketball games that's going to make it OK. One slip of the knife and your elite eight becomes a final four. 
"
James Corden,Trump University did not make it this year. Apparently the NCAA has these really strict rules that say the college can't be a made-up Ponzi scheme.
Jimmy Fallon,"At a rally over the weekend, Donald Trump was surrounded by Secret Service agents after a man tried to rush the stage. The Secret Service said the man was dangerous and disturbed, but they had to protect him anyway. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Proving once and for all, the best way to keep everyone safe and sound is to build a wall around Donald Trump. 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"On Friday, a 112-year-old man was given the Guinness World Record for being the world's oldest living man. When asked how he achieved the record, the man said, “I jumped out and scared my older brother.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"When asked how he plans to celebrate, he said, “By defeating Hillary Clinton to be the Democratic nominee.”"
Jimmy Fallon,A town in Maine is facing pressure to rename a street called Katie's Crotch Road. Lawmakers said that they understood people's concerns and announced the street's new name: Linda's Crotch Road. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"How is it that my air bag knows exactly when I'm going to get into an accident, but my car can't figure out how to go forward an hour for Daylight Savings Time? 

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"They did a study, there's an increase in fatal heart attacks in the three days after we change the clocks. Probably from looking at your watch, realizing you were supposed to have picked up your kid at preschool an hour ago. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Every appliance with a clock should have a Daylight Savings button to push. You'd only use it twice a year, but that's more than I use the ""Potato"" button on my microwave. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Mitt Romney hit the campaign trail today with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who's hoping to beat Donald Trump in his home state. Romney is stumping for Kasich in Ohio and Rubio in Florida with the idea that he will stop Donald Trump. He's also got Holy Cross and Iona going into the finals in his NCAA bracket. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Romney took the stage with Kasich at an air museum that's halfway between Akron and Canton. I love the idea of Mitt Romney and John Kasich teaming up. It's like a buddy cop movie, only they're both the cop who plays by the rules. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Ted Cruz stopped Trump in Texas. Then the plan is if they get to the convention, they're going to have Dr. Ben Carson sew all their bodies together to form one enormous super-candidate who just might have enough delegates to win."
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Obama seems like he's enjoying this whole thing. He spoke at a fundraiser in Dallas where he took a moment to ruminate about Donald Trump-brand wine. I think Obama's in his ""I only have 10 months left so to hell with it"" phase. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"
Maybe he'll host the Oscars next year. 
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"The big story of the day, bigger than politics, bigger than sports, bigger than anything, was ""The Bachelor."" The only good thing about Daylight Savings Time is we didn't have to wait another hour to find out who Ben chose. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"In the end, Ben asked Lauren B. to be his wife and she said yes. They're still together. Already this is one of the longer-lasting engagements in ""Bachelor"" history. "
