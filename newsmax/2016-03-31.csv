James Corden,"In an interview with a Swedish newspaper, an Iraqi woman revealed that she was married to a man for months before discovering that he was the leader of ISIS. Now, as much as that's bad news for her, it's good for us men, right? Because my wife thought it was bad that I sometimes sneak eating Krispy Kremes. It turns out it could be so much worse. "
James Corden,"This woman should have been tipped off when during the vows at their wedding the groom said, ""Until death to America do us part."" "
James Corden,"She said she thought it was strange that her husband would disappear for weeks at a time. But it makes sense. His man cave was literally a cave. 
"
James Corden,"If she does finally find a new boyfriend, I feel bad for that guy. He's never going to be able to say, “I'm just going away for the weekend with the boys.” She'll be like, “Oh, are you, Josh? Or are you the head of ISIS?” "
Jimmy Fallon,"Tomorrow is April Fools’ Day, which means everyone will be waiting for Donald Trump to finally say, “Gotcha! I never wanted to be president! I can’t believe you dummies let it go on this long!”"

Jimmy Fallon,"
If Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are the two nominees, it will be the first time both parties' nominees are over 65 years old. Which should explain that one debate where they just play checkers in the park. “King me!”

Jimmy Kimmel,"President Obama yesterday commuted the sentences of 61 federal prisoners, most of whom were low-level drug offenders. Then he had lunch with a bunch of them.
