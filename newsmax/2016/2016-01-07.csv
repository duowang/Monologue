James Corden,"Hillary Clinton complained about having to take selfies with voters, saying that it takes up too much time at campaign events. Yeah, good one, Hillary. That's the way to capture the youth vote — directly criticize their favorite thing in the whole world. "
James Corden,"Hillary said she doesn't like selfies because the interaction is very impersonal. She said, 
""If anything is going to be impersonal on this campaign trail, I prefer it to be me.""
"
James Corden,Meanwhile Bernie Sanders announced that he loves selfies. He just hasn't figured out how to take them on his rotary phone.
James Corden,"There was a landmark case this week and a judge has ruled that a monkey can't own the copyright for a selfie it took with a photographer's camera. How sad must it be for the lawyer who had to represent a monkey? Like imagine he was there going, ""Your honor, I object to the way my life has turned out."""
James Corden,"One thing is for sure, this case was bananas. Although, the monkey may win on a-peel."
Conan O'Brian,"Donald Trump is now accusing Ted Cruz of having a Canadian passport. Cruz said he doesn’t have a Canadian passport, but like everyone else he’ll get one the minute Donald Trump becomes president."
Conan O'Brian,"Scientists say they have discovered evidence of the mating habits of dinosaurs. What they found are giant footprints from the world’s first ""Walk of Shame."""
Conan O'Brian,"In Southern California, residents can get up to $100 if they use rain barrels to catch extra rainwater. Experts say it’s a great way to make money, two days a year. "
Conan O'Brian,"Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who was videotaped smoking crack, now says he wants to be Toronto’s mayor again. When asked why he wants the job again, he said, ""So I can afford to buy crack."""
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Powerball jackpot is at $700 million, which is roughly one ""Star Wars"" movie. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"
It's the biggest lottery jackpot in history. Never before has the total been this big. Nobody won last night. So they're going to do it again on Saturday. It was originally reported that Miss Colombia had won the jackpot. 
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Our current president, the one named Obama, is gearing up for what will be his final state of the union address on Tuesday night. His aides have been describing the speech that he plans to give as nontraditional. Which probably means he's going to do that “watch me whip, watch me nae nae"" dance."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Experts say El Niño might not help us much with the drought. Most of the storms are hitting southern California instead of northern California, where most of our reservoirs are — it's kind of like if you were dying of thirst and someone washed your feet. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"General Motors is teaming up with Lyft, the car ride service that's like Uber, to build a fleet of self-driving cars. It's a $500 million deal, and the idea is these cars would someday be used to take passengers wherever they want to go without a driver. Which to me sounds like a great way to get accidentally taken to another city because you typed in the wrong movie theater and then your phone dies and you can't change it. "
Jimmy Fallon,"In an interview on “Morning Joe” yesterday, Donald Trump said that he thinks the media is starting to like him. Then the media said, “Like you? Have you seen our ratings? We LOVE you!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Donald Trump's wife, Melania, gave an interview and said she remembers her first date with Donald like it was two months ago. Then it got awkward when she was like, “But the marks on my wall clearly show that it's been 17 years, two months, and six days.”"
Jimmy Fallon,We’re now just a few days away from President Obama's final State of the Union Address. Which means Joe Biden only has a few days left to decide what weird thing he's gonna do in the background. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday in Alabama, a bomb squad was called in to a post office to handle suspicious bags that ended up being full of hot dogs. So if you know someone who left a bag full of hot dogs at the post office, you should still call the police. "
Stephen Colbert,"We've reached an important milestone in the 2016 presidential campaign — it is 2016. 

"
Stephen Colbert,"Donald Trump is questioning whether his opponent Ted Cruz is actually a U.S. citizen because, in 1970, Cruz was born to a Canadian-Cuban father and an American mother and I'm going to guess a crock of Dippity-do. "
Stephen Colbert,"Cruz has mocked the ridiculousness of Trump's allegations by posting a video on Twitter of Fonzie from ""Happy Days"" jumping the shark. Which I say proves Cruz is an American, because if he were a Canadian he would have released a video of Celine Dion jumping a Tim Hortons."
Seth Meyers,"Vice President Joe Biden in a new interview said that he wakes up every day regretting that he didn't enter the 2016 race. And every day Hillary Clinton holds the rag over his nose and he goes back to sleep.
