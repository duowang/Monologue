So I assume it's maybe barefoot, on the beach, everyone's in linen, rolled cuffs, and instead of a State of the Union cake, maybe cupcakes."
Seth Meyers,"On Friday, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was finally captured by Mexican authorities, six months after tunneling out of prison for the second time. It's good they put him on a helicopter. Once it's airborne, it makes the tunneling a little more hazardous."
Seth Meyers,"The day after El Chapo's capture, Rolling Stone published a secret interview Sean Penn had done with El Chapo months before that is filled with humanizing details about the misunderstood drug lord — he's a pretty good guy. He only kills people when he can make money off it."

James Corden,We all had to go to work this morning because none of us won the Powerball. Nobody has won the Powerball lottery since November. And the jackpot is now sitting at $1.4 billion. That's almost three days' worth of groceries from Whole Foods. 
James Corden,The truth is that the odds of you winning are 290 million to 1. That means are you about as likely to win the Powerball as you are to ever hear the words “President Jeb Bush.” 
James Corden,"The Playboy Mansion is up for sale for $200 million. Yeah, you could own the house that was recently named the stickiest mansion in America. "

Hugh Hefner comes with the house — Hugh Hefner must be granted residence on the property for as long as he lives. That means if you buy the Playboy Mansion you could be living with Hugh Hefner all the way through February. "

Jimmy Fallon,"Republican candidates aired a dozen new TV ads last week, even though recent data has shown that TV ads are mostly ineffective. Chris Christie was like, “If TV ads aren't effective, why do I keep going to Wendy's for their Gouda Bacon Cheeseburger, here ONLY for a limited time?”"
Jimmy Fallon,"A day after he was caught, it came out that Mexican drug lord El Chapo actually sat down for an interview with Sean Penn while he was on the run. In the interview, El Chapo described himself as “a person who's not looking for problems in any way.” You know, except for that whole “Mexican drug lord” thing. “I’m just a humble drug lord! I chop up my enemies one leg at a time, just like anybody else.”"

Jimmy Kimmel,"El Chapo is the Mexican drug kingpin who was recaptured on Friday. He has been in hiding since he escaped from a maximum security prison in July and somehow wound up doing an interview with Sean Penn. Apparently he was hoping to get a movie made about his life. What a great plot twist, adding Sean Penn. I mean, the thing is writing itself. I wonder who Sean will get to play Sean in the movie."
Jimmy Kimmel,El Chapo is back in the same prison he escaped from six months ago but they revoked his tunnel privileges this time. The plan is they're hoping to extradite him to the United States so he can be tried by a jury of his customers.
Jimmy Kimmel,"That is, if he doesn't escape again. He's very good at getting away. He's really the closest thing Mexico has to a leprechaun."
