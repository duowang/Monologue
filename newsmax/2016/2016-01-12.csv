James Corden,"It's been nearly two weeks since members of an anti-government militia took over a federal bird sanctuary in Oregon in order to protest the government's control of federal lands. The members of the militia are heavily armed with AR-15s, AK-47s, and other lethal weaponry one would expect to find on a bunch of dudes guarding some cockatoos. "
James Corden,"This is such a controversial story. Even the birds are split on this. Some are right-winged, some are left-winged. "
James Corden,"Ammon Bundy, the leader of the militia, has compared his occupation of the wildlife refuge to that of Rosa Parks. And I think we all remember when Rosa Parks got on a public bus, sat down, then whipped out an AK-47 and threatened to kill anyone who made her change seats."
James Corden,"The militia are short on supplies, and have released a wish list of items they hope people will donate to their cause. You have to see this list. These guys did not plan ahead. They're asking for four aprons, ice scrapers, candles, throw rugs. It's like a wedding registry for the most boring couple you know."
James Corden,"There is only one thing they say they needed badly on this list — eggs. They need eggs badly, at a bird sanctuary."

Jimmy Fallon,"Marco Rubio's campaign said that it expects to lose the first four states in the primary elections, but thinks he can win the nomination anyway. Which is sort of like not getting a rose on “The Bachelor,” and being like, “Call me!”"
Jimmy Kimmel,"This Powerball drawing is tomorrow night. The pot is up to $1.5 billion — a record, almost triple the previous jackpot. To put that in perspective, $1.5 billion is almost half of Oprah."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tonight before a joint session of Congress, President Obama delivered his seventh and final State of the Union address. In this one he tried to focus on the positive. For example, he's positive nothing he proposes will get done over the next year. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Republicans control both houses so it's going to be very difficult for the president to pass any new legislation. The only bill more unpopular than a bill from President Obama right now is a Bill Cosby.
