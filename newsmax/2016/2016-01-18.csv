Conan O'Brian,"Today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It’s a very important day, it’s the day where the struggle for racial equality is remembered by all Americans and snubbed by the Oscar committee."

Seth Meyers,Today is Martin Luther King Day. And Donald Trump saw his shadow this morning so that means six more weeks of racism.
