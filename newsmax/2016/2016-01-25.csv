After a really warm December, this was kind of a relief. Climate change has not ended winter, it just packed the whole damn thing into one weekend. 
"
Stephen Colbert,All weekend I put on my top-notch winter gear: pajamas. They were plenty waterproof because I did not leave the house or take a shower. I did get up early on Sunday to do some shoveling of pancakes into my mouth. 
Stephen Colbert,"There’s a little heart app on your phone to tell you how much you moved for the day and I have been using that lately. It tracks the number of steps you take in a day. You are supposed to get something like 10,000 in a day and I'm usually pretty close. Here's Friday: Almost 9,000 steps, not bad. Here's Saturday: 20 steps.  "

Jimmy Fallon,"We got over 2 feet of snow here in New York City, and more than 11,000 flights were canceled because of the blizzard. In fact, there's so many people waiting around at the airport, they had to open a Chili's Three. "

Jimmy Kimmel,"A lot of people got stranded over the weekend and flights were canceled. There was more than 2 feet of snow in Washington, D.C., and New York.

Good news is you have the day off today. Bad news, you're worthless.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,Did you watch the football games yesterday in the matchup for Super Bowl 50? It's the guy from the Under Armour commercials against the guy from the Papa John's commercials.
Jimmy Kimmel,"In Elkmont, Alabama, last weekend a dog got loose and ended up on a half marathon. The dog saw all the people and just started running with them. She did well. She finished seventh place. She would have finished higher if she hadn't stopped every once in a while to sniff everyone's butts. "
