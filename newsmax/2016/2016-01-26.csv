Seth Meyers,"Democrats held a presidential forum last night on CNN where candidates were interviewed individually. Candidates were asked questions like, ""What would you do about the wage gap?"" ""Do you plan to raise taxes?"" And, ""How did you get in here?"" "
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump said this morning during an interview that Ted Cruz ""looks like a jerk."" And claimed that Cruz has no friends in Congress and is usually standing all by himself. So is he running for president or leader of the Plastics? "
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump said that Ted Cruz is a liar who looks like a jerk. Not to be confused with Trump, who is a jerk who looks like a liar. "
Seth Meyers,"A matador in Spain is under investigation after a video surfaced of him bullfighting while holding his 5-month-old baby girl in his arms. But to be fair, it was Take Your Daughter to Work Day. "

You can tell he doesn't go to church much because he was like, ""I really like the part where they passed me the basket of free money."" "
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night CNN hosted a Democratic forum where Hillary Clinton said that if she's elected she wants to work together with Republicans and even said she'd give them all bear hugs. By bear hugs she means like the ones you saw in ""The Revenant."" "

Jimmy Kimmel,U.S. News & World Report today released their annual list of the Best Jobs for 2016. The two best jobs are orthodontist and dentist. I've always considered the best job to be the one where you don't have to put your hand in other people's mouths. 
Jimmy Kimmel,Four out of five dentists agreed with the list. The fifth dentist was that same jerk who disagrees with everything. 
Jimmy Kimmel,The best part of an orthodontist's job is when she asks you how your holidays were while you're gagging on half a pound of cotton. 
Jimmy Kimmel,Really the best job in America is to be born a Kardashian. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"The last job on the list this year, the least desirable job for 2016? Bill Cosby's publicist. "

Jimmy Kimmel,"The Iowa caucuses are less than a week away. Then after that the candidates can go back to ignoring Iowa completely. 

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
We give so much attention to who Iowa picks. Since 1980 the Iowa Caucus has predicted the Republican nominee incorrectly four times. They only got it right twice. You get better odds when you have a zoo animal predict the winner of the Super Bowl than these Iowa caucuses. 
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"On CNN last night they had what they call a town hall meeting where the Democratic candidates try to woo the Iowa voters. The only clear winner of this debate-slash-meeting was the farmer who got $30,000 to let CNN park the satellite trucks in his corn field. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Someone asked Hillary who her favorite president was, and she said — with apologies to President Obama — “My husband, Bill.

Jimmy Kimmel,"Martin O'Malley, who for some reason is still under the impression he's running for president, got some good shots in, but this was his big moment. During the Q&A; portion he said, “I can't just sit here. I have to take off my jacket and stand up!” And he rolled up his sleeves and showed off his body. It's like “Magic Martin.” "
