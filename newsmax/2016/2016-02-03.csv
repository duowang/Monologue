Seth Meyers,"President Obama today made his first visit to a mosque while in office. He visited a mosque! Which means he’s officially entered the phase of his presidency known as “come at me, bro.”"
Seth Meyers,"Recently released documents show that former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer donated $50,000 to Martin O’Malley’s presidential campaign. It’s not the first time Spitzer spent that much on something that only lasted an hour."
Seth Meyers,"According to a new report, Americans spent more money last year on legal marijuana than they did on Doritos and Cheetos combined. Or as pot smokers call that, “a salad.”"
Conan O'Brian,"Sarah Palin accused Ted Cruz of lying about Ben Carson and stealing the Iowa caucus. This is my favorite thing in politics, when people lie and cheat to get the evangelical Christian vote."
Conan O'Brian,"This morning, Donald Trump tweeted that Ted Cruz ""illegally stole"" the election. Trump said, ""Everyone knows you’re supposed to illegally BUY the election."""
Conan O'Brian,"Bernie Sanders says his campaign is trying to appeal now to senior citizens. The problem is, every time Bernie says, ""Feel the Bern,"" the seniors think he’s talking about acid reflux."
Conan O'Brian,"This week, Mike Huckabee, Martin O’Malley, Rand Paul, and Rick Santorum have all decided to drop out of the race. Which explains Jeb Bush’s new campaign slogan, ""I can’t take a hint."""
Conan O'Brian,"A Papa John’s customer is suing the restaurant over what he calls an improper 16-cent tax. He’s also suing them for ""improper use of the word 'pizza.'"""

James Corden,"An associate of Osama bin Laden's who is currently being held prisoner in Guantanamo Bay was recently found to have a Match.com profile. I guess we know the answer to the question, ""Your place or mine?"""
James Corden,"In order to update his profile from prison, he writes letters to his lawyer. This guy writes updates about a wide variety of things, for example, about Caitlyn Jenner he wrote, ""Happy for her because people are born the way they are."" I can't believe I'm going to say this but I think I have a favorite member of al-Qaida. I'm not saying I like him, he's just my favorite — he's the best of a bad bunch."
James Corden,"Do you think his opening line with women was ""Jihad me at hello?"""
Jimmy Fallon,"On Monday, Hillary Clinton narrowly won in Iowa, with the final results showing that she beat Bernie Sanders by less than 1 percent. And you thought Bernie was mad at the 1 percent BEFORE. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Hillary is facing criticism for declaring victory in Iowa prematurely. The final results weren't actually announced till around 1 p.m. on Tuesday, but she declared victory back in April of last year."
Jimmy Fallon,"After receiving less than 1 percent support in the Iowa caucuses, Martin O'Malley suspended his presidential campaign. In a related story, the New York Jets have announced that they've decided to not play in the Super Bowl this weekend."

Jimmy Kimmel,"After the caucus in Iowa, the candidates who had no chance to win are finally starting to realize that and drop out. Rick Santorum announced he's suspending his campaign after he finished 11th in Iowa and Rand Paul is suspending his campaign after finishing fifth. I like that they call it suspending, as if their campaigns got caught having sex under the bleachers and will be back in a couple of weeks."
Jimmy Kimmel,Rand Paul deserves a lot of credit. He said time and time again he believes in smaller government. Now that he's out of the race the government is indeed one person smaller. That's called practicing what you preach.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Jeb Bush finished sixth behind Rand Paul who dropped out, but Jeb Bush is still running. He doesn't know what to do — if he loses he can't go home because his father and brother will laugh at him."
