James Corden,"After saying he would never ditch his glasses, this week Jeb Bush appeared wearing contact lenses. Most people actually do look cooler without glasses, but Jeb looks like a turtle who has lost his shell. "

James Corden,"When Barack Obama was asked if Donald Trump could be president, he said, ""I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president. And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people."" A president with faith in his citizens? I trust everything this guy says. "

Jimmy Kimmel,Pope Francis is in Mexico this week where we got to see something yesterday I don't think we've ever seen from a Pope — anger. The Pope all of a sudden gets annoyed and starts yelling at someone in the crowd. I don't know who he yelled at but it's kind of fun to see a pissed-off Pope.
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Obama said he believes Mr. Trump will not be president because the American people “recognize that being president is a serious job. It's not hosting a talk show."" Maybe I don't get to do “serious” stuff like pardoning a turkey on Thanksgiving but I'll tell you something, Mr. Obama: Every minute of every day I'm thinking about how to keep Americans safe from Matt Damon."
