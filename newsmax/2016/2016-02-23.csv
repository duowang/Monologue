"
Seth Meyers,At a rally in Las Vegas last night Donald Trump told supporters he’d like to punch protesters in the face. Though he looks more like the kind of guy who would stroke a white cat while somebody else punched you in the face.
Seth Meyers,"Hillary Clinton recently visited the set of the hit ABC show “Scandal.” Is that really the show you should be visiting right now? Why not drop by the set of “I Did Nothing Wrong,” or maybe “There Was Nothing Illegal in Those Emails!” "

James Corden,"Starbucks has unveiled a new rewards system. Previously, you needed only 12 rewards ""Stars"" to get a free drink; you now need 125. This has made Starbucks customers very angry, and these are people who pay $5 for a cup of coffee. It's hard to get them angry."
James Corden,"I mean, this is all so frustrating. If only there was some way for people to make their own coffee, at home. "
James Corden,"Starbucks' reward currency is called ""Stars."" I like to picture the boardroom meeting for the naming of Starbucks currency. ""I've got it! Stars! It's in our name. If I had a buck for every time I thought of an idea this good…"" "
James Corden,"Just a few months ago, people were furious that Starbucks removed Christmas imagery from their cups, and last year, customers got angry that pumpkin spice didn't contain any actual pumpkin. I think the real problem here is that drinking that much caffeine every day turns you into a [whiner]. "

Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump was heavily favored to win. Not just by Donald Trump, by other people too. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are in a fierce battle for second place. Ted Cruz is very “Trumpy” lately. He just released an ad promising to sell off or give away all of Nevada's public lands, national parks, forests and monuments, which is a great idea if you're a cult leader or the founder of a polygamist sect. If you're a citizen, maybe not. "
