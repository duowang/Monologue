Conan O'Brian,"In last night's Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton said that several times a day, she speaks to God. But never for under $100,000."
Conan O'Brian,"Donald Trump has dropped to second place in a national poll. On the bright side, he’s still polling No. 1 among ""Germans of the 1930s."""
Conan O'Brian,"Over the weekend, Arnold Schwarzenegger officially endorsed John Kasich. Or he said ""a horse junkie is sick,"" it’s hard to tell."
Conan O'Brian,"Today, Broncos star quarterback Peyton Manning retired. Manning thanked his wife, his kids, and the most influential man in his life, Papa John."
Conan O'Brian,"Over the weekend, Beyoncé performed at a fundraiser for her daughter’s preschool. Five minutes into the performance, Beyoncé said, ""Screw it,"" and just bought the preschool."

Conan O'Brian,"Colin Powell said recently that the Republican candidates are playing ""junior high school tricks on one another."" Powell then excused himself to take a call from someone looking for Dick Hertz."
James Corden,Yesterday there was yet another presidential debate. I think it was like the 247th debate in this election. 
James Corden,"During this debate between the Democratic candidates, CNN anchor Don Lemon referenced the Broadway musical “Avenue Q,” asking if everyone is a little bit racist and what racial blind spot do you have? "
James Corden,"“What racial blind spot do you have” is an unanswerable question. No one is going to answer that. No candidate is going, “Well, Don I'm glad you asked. I'm racist in the following way.” Why are they asking questions about musicals? "
James Corden,"But there was a moment last night where Bernie Sanders kind of struggled. He said when you're white you don't know what it is like to live in a ghetto. And some people are angry at Bernie for using the word ghetto. And they're reacting as if he was just endorsed by the KKK. Actually, they're not reacting that way. If they were, he would be in first place. "
James Corden,"I personally didn’t see it, actually. I missed hearing Bernie talking about what it’s like to be white last night because I was busy watching the finale of “Downton Abbey,” while browsing the L.L. Bean catalog. "
James Corden,"Speaking of white people, a man attended a Donald Trump rally this weekend dressed as the wall that Trump wants to build between the U.S. and Mexico. This person made a powerful political statement. And that statement is: I'm a virgin. "
Seth Meyers,"The NYPD has announced they'll no longer arrest people for petty crimes like littering, public drinking, and urination. Which means one thing -- Times Square is back, baby! "
Seth Meyers,"Instead, lawbreakers will now just receive a summons. Great news for low-level offenders who used to get carted off in handcuffs, and bad news for anyone into that sort of thing. 
"
Seth Meyers,"I'm a little concerned about the timing. Is it wise to lift restrictions on public drinking and urination the week before St. Patrick's Day? To all my viewers in New York, please seek high ground and start piling sand bags.  "
Seth Meyers,"Marco Rubio has been going hard after Donald Trump, even making fun of Donald's small hands. And I didn't have a show on Friday, so it's been four days since Trump's response, but I don't care, this is what I do for a living, and there's no way I'm going to let an entire election go by without talking about this"
Seth Meyers,"But Donald, the issue is out there, and the people have the right to know the size of your ""Executive Branch."" So I'm calling on you to release the long form. Or the short form. No judgment. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Big news around here: It rained today. There was rain and even hail this morning. Either that or Justin Bieber was pelting our houses with tiny little eggs.
Jimmy Kimmel,There were more caucuses and primaries over the weekend. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz each won two states. Rubio won Puerto Rico. Bernie Sanders won a few states. Hillary Clinton won big in Louisiana. Everyone went home with a win letter just like soccer camp. Even John Kasich got one for participation. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"He also got a high-profile endorsement from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold officially endorsed John Kasich yesterday. Or maybe he endorsed a chicken quesadilla, I have no idea. I really don't know what he's saying. He can't even say ""State of California."" "
Jimmy Kimmel,"He endorsed Gov. Kasich and gave him a hug, looked like he could pop his head off. This is particularly interesting. Basically Gov. Kasich is hoping to beat the former host of ""The Apprentice"" with help from the current host of ""The Apprentice,"" Arnold Schwarzenegger. "
Jimmy Kimmel,This is such a strange election. I personally am waiting to see who Dolph Lundgren endorses before I make my decision. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Last week, we had Super Tuesday. On Tuesday. This morning I turn on CNN to find out they're calling tomorrow Super Tuesday 2. There can't be a Super Tuesday 2. Tuesday 2 already has a name — it's Wednesday. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tinder is testing out what they call a share button. If you see someone on Tinder who you think might be right for someone you know, you can send their profile and your friend can then swipe right for yes or left for no, making you the matchmaker — or setting up a threesome, I don't know. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tinder is always coming up with new and exciting ways to force us to have sex with each other. Isn't the point of being on Tinder that you don't have to get set up? Now that they have this, how long before your mom gets on it and ruins it for you? “I swiped you right, honey!” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tinder was designed to get relationships started. There's another new service to help you break up. It's called the Breakup Shop. It's a real company. You can hire them to send a breakup text or make a breakup phone call. A text is $10. A phone call is $29. Why you wouldn't just do this yourself, I have no idea. But they'll also send a card that smells like [manure] if you prefer something old-fashioned. "
