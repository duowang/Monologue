Seth Meyers,The season finale of “The Bachelor” was last night and a lot of people were upset that the ending was spoiled by social media. While other people were upset that our once-great American society was spoiled by “The Bachelor.”
Seth Meyers,Of course the season isn’t REALLY over until everyone gets their test results back. 
Seth Meyers,"According to a new report, Dr. Ben Carson was not planning to endorse any of the remaining candidates, but changed his mind after being offered a position in Trump’s White House. He would run the Department of No Energy."
Seth Meyers,"Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg have signed on to make a new Indiana Jones sequel set for release in 2019. It will be like the other movies, but now when he cracks his whip the sound is actually coming from his knees."
Stephen Colbert,"There was a major Internet outage, striking at the core of our nation's online infrastructure, Tinder."
Stephen Colbert,"The dating app went down for several hours yesterday, leaving singles with zero dating options, except for OKCupid, Bumble, Hinge, Scruff, Match, Grindr, let's say Bumpr, Hamburglars, and Fruit Ninja. Some users lost all their matches and messages, which means they can never go back and relive that magical moment when Darryl from Long Island texted ""sup?"""
Stephen Colbert,"""The Bachelor"" finale was three hours long. At this point, “The Bachelor” is 85 percent of what's on ABC, which now stands for ""A Bachelor Channel."""
Stephen Colbert,"On a previous episode, bachelor Ben made ""Bachelor"" history by telling two women that he was in love with them. I can see why. They're both attractive, intelligent, and if you combine them, nearly the weight of one adult woman."
James Corden,Today is Super Tuesday. Again. Am I the only one who thinks there are starting to be more Super Tuesdays than normal Tuesdays? They're even calling it Super Tuesday 3. 
James Corden,"If we've learned anything from Hollywood franchises, then today will be an expensive letdown."
James Corden,"Over the weekend, Hillary was endorsed by a California leader of the KKK, Will Quigg, because he believes she will do the exact opposite of what she promises and that she's an ""undercover Hitler."" That makes me think three things. 1) She's not. 2) She's definitely not. And 3) ""Undercover Hitler"" sounds like the worst spin-off of ""Undercover Boss."""
Jimmy Fallon,"Hillary Clinton is going to appear in this week's episode of the Comedy Central show “Broad City.” Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders will actually be appraised on “Antiques Roadshow.” "
Jimmy Fallon,A lot of people voted today in primaries across five different states. Some people are even calling it “Super Tuesday 3.” Although Marco Rubio is just calling it “Mission: Impossible 3.”
Jimmy Fallon,"A new poll found that the majority of millennials would vote for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Then millennials found out you can't vote by texting and said, ""Never mind!"""
Jimmy Fallon,"A Donald Trump rally was delayed for nearly two hours yesterday due to fog. At one point the fog was so thick, Trump supporters couldn’t even see who they were punching.  "
Jimmy Kimmel,Last night was the big finale of “The Bachelor” and the good news for JoJo is she did not find love with bachelor Ben but she is going to be the next bachelorette. So this is our circle of life here at ABC — it's hakuna ma-hot-tub.
Jimmy Kimmel,"There were primaries in five states today. CNN dubbed today Super Tuesday 3 and we are now another Tuesday closer to finally having a president who has his own line of vodka named after himself. 

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump has claimed that his candidacy is fueling more interest in voting. More people are signing up to vote. Just like herpes fuels more interest in Valtrex, for instance. 

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Most of the focus tonight was on Florida and Ohio. And if there's one thing I know, it's that you can always trust Florida to make the right decision."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders in Florida. And I'll say, that's tough for Bernie because a 74-year-old Jewish man can't win in Florida.
