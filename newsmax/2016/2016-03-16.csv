Stephen Colbert,"I'm a bit of a web-head. I like to find the hidden, out-of-the-way corners of the Internet, and I stumbled across a gem recently you might enjoy. It's called Amazon.com. "
Stephen Colbert,"It's got everything: Books, appliances, and if you just order two AA batteries, it comes packed with 30 sealed bags full of Chinese air. That's a cheap high."
Stephen Colbert,"Amazon's got this new voice-activated home assistant gadget called the Echo. You just talk to the Echo, and it tells you the weather or sports scores or controls the lighting or climate in your house. "
Stephen Colbert," Now, the Echo is always listening, but it only activates when you say its name: Alexa. It's a pretty name, much prettier than the earlier name, the privacy-destroyer spy-mic 5000. "
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump won yesterday’s Republican primaries in Florida, Illinois, and North Carolina.  Trump did especially well with white males, Caucasian men, and non-women of no color."
Seth Meyers,"While announcing last night that he is dropping out, Marco Rubio told supporters, “We should have seen this coming.” If it makes you feel any better, Marco, we did."
Seth Meyers,"President Obama announced today that he is nominating Washington, D.C. Circuit Court Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. “I can’t win anything this week!” screamed JoJo from The Bachelor."
Seth Meyers,"Barry Bonds reportedly showed up to Miami Marlins spring training today and beat the entire team at a home run contest, despite being 51 years old, which raises the question — Why you still taking steroids, Barry?"
Seth Meyers,"Alexa, order me the earthquake 1427 wood chipper with 212-cc, 4-cycle viper engine. I will pay for expedited shipping. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Donald Trump won every Republican state primary last night except for Ohio, which went to John Kasich. Trump didn't seem to mind, since, as he put it, “The word Ohio is full of zeros.” (It's 50 percent zeros!)"
Jimmy Fallon,Marco Rubio pulled out of the race after losing the Florida primary to Trump by almost 20 points. But he still has a great story. I mean nothing symbolizes America more than the son of poor immigrants growing up to run for president and being crushed by a billionaire.
Jimmy Fallon,"7-Eleven will hold its second annual “Bring Your Own Cup Day,” where it will give customers a discounted Slurpee as long as they bring in any container resembling a cup. In a related story, Home Depot just sold out of trash cans."
Jimmy Fallon,"Selena Gomez just became the most-followed person on Instagram with almost 70 million followers. When reached for comment, Kim Kardashian said, “I can't get any more naked, guys. I’ve shown you everything I got.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,"According to the Annual World Happiness Report, the United States is the 13th happiest country in the world. We might have just dropped to 17th, I don't know. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"You know what the happiest country in the world is? Denmark. Danish people are the happiest. Of course they're happy, they have a pastry named after them. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"The top 10 were Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden. Basically all the countries represented in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Of course, the numbers are subject to change when President Trump takes office and makes us great again. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump won four of the five primaries last night. Assuming she wins Missouri, Hillary Clinton went five for five in the primaries. Disappointing night for Bernie Sanders, which was a surprise; he was polling well among everyone's most annoying Facebook friends. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"The bad news for the leaders of both parties, both Clinton and Trump have a very high unfavorability rating. Hillary is 53 percent unfavorable, Trump clocks in at an extraordinary 63 percent unfavorable. Which, I think, like only Jared from Subway has higher than that. "
Jimmy Kimmel,This election is going to be the political equivalent of having lunch at Panda Express — nobody wins. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"The big win for Trump was in Marco Rubio's home state of Florida. Rubio won one county in his home state, Miami. That was thanks to a last-minute endorsement from the sound machine. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"A disappointing finish for Marco Rubio. A man who fueled his campaign with all the fire and spontaneity of Vicki the robot from ""Small Wonder."" "
Jimmy Kimmel,"After the announcement, Rubio dropped out of the race. He went back to Washington and locked his office door to make sure no Supreme Court nominees get in. So good luck to him. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Meanwhile, our future president, Kanye West, has a new creative mission. Kanye tweeted to the owner of the L.A. Clippers asking if he could redesign the Clippers' mascot. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"
If he designs mascots the way he names albums we'll see three or four new mascots every week. Or maybe instead of letting Kanye redesign the mascot, they could make Kanye himself the Clippers mascot. 
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Never mind the t-shirt cannon, that's how you get people fired up. "
