James Corden,Chris Christie was the focus of a shaming campaign after a fan at a basketball game photographed him seemingly pouring a bag of M&Ms; into a box of M&Ms.; I guarantee you Chris Christie did not know the score of that basketball game. 
James Corden,Are we really shocked Chris Christie is eating M&Ms;? The man endorsed Trump. He sucks at making healthy decisions. 
James Corden,My point is that Chris Christie eating M&Ms; isn't something that should go viral. It's basically what we expect. Like nobody would get excited if they caught Bernie Sanders cutting his own hair in a bus station bathroom. It's just what he does.

Seth Meyers,"The DEA has announced that by the middle of the year they may decide to remove marijuana from its Schedule 1 category of dangerous drugs. Because, let’s face it, it’s absurd to have “marijuana” and “schedule” in the same sentence."
