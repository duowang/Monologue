Seth Meyers,"Bernie Sanders this morning joined the Verizon workers picket line here in New York. It’s a perfect match, because Bernie always talks like he’s getting bad reception."
Seth Meyers,"Bernie Sanders today received his first senatorial endorsement from Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley. Or as he’ll be known under President Hillary Clinton, “Ambassador to North Korea Jeff Merkley.”"
Seth Meyers,The New York MTA has announced that they plan to phase out MetroCards by 2021. “But I just learned!” said Hillary. 
Jimmy Fallon,"The big New York primary, which happens next Tuesday, is looking pretty good for Hillary Clinton. In fact, website FiveThirtyEight says Hillary has a 99 percent chance of winning the primary for New York. When he heard, Bernie Sanders said, “My God, I've become part of the 1 percent!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night, CNN hosted a town hall with Republican front-runner Donald Trump, and at one point he complained that the rules of the election are stacked against him “by the establishment.” You gotta give it to Trump. He's the only man who could inherit millions of dollars, have his name on buildings, and still go, “Life is totally unfair!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump’s family was also at the town hall, and Trump’s daughter Ivanka was asked if the election is straining her friendship with Chelsea Clinton. Which means we have officially begun the presidential campaign of 2032, everybody!"
Jimmy Fallon,I read that audience members at the Broadway musical version of “American Psycho” are complaining that fake blood has been splattering on the people sitting in the front row. It's not just ruining their clothes — it's making it impossible for them to hail a cab after the show. “OK — I can explain the blood!”
Jimmy Kimmel,"After 20 years, Kobe Bryant tonight played his final game in purple and gold. He suited up for the Lakers for the very last time. Kobe's officially retired from basketball. The rest of the team retired in November. "

Jimmy Kimmel,"The new Spider-Man is a teenager. Last night they unveiled the title and logo for the new Spider-Man film, ""Spider-Man Homecoming."" Which is interesting. When I was in high school, ""Spider-Man"" is what I was reading instead of going to homecoming. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Some prominent Republican congressmen are saying they might not even go to the convention, which is in Cleveland this summer. Not because it might get crazy — they're saying they can't go because they have work to do. This summer. These are congressmen. All of a sudden they've got work to do? "
