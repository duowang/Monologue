Jimmy Kimmel,I want to wish everyone a happy Tax Day. I guess it's only happy if you get money back. I hate that you have to put stamps on the envelope to send in. They can't just throw that in? They charge us $1.41 to have the honor of sending them half the money we earn this year.
Jimmy Kimmel,This is the kind of money the candidates should be focused on right now. Tax returns are basically an 11th grade math test administered to adults. If we fail we go to prison. That's how it works. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"The president and the first lady got their taxes done. I'm not sure if they have to release it or they just do. They made $436, 035, the lowest amount they've made since he took office. Donald Trump made more money than that last year selling hats. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"AC/DC has a new lead singer. Axle rose will replace Brian Johnson. At 54-years-old, he will be the youngest member of the group. They are still on a “Highway to Hell,” but they're in the far right lane. "
