Stephen Colbert,"Today is primary day right here in the Big Apple. A day when New Yorkers proudly line up at the voting booth and declare with one voice, ""Hurry up in there, I got stuff to do."""
Stephen Colbert,Britain's National Environmental Research Council announced a boat-naming contest a little over a month ago in an effort to build public interest in Arctic research — while there is still some Arctic left to research. 
Stephen Colbert,"Thousands of entries were submitted and the name ""Boaty McBoatface"" got four times more votes than any other name. I believe it's the best name for a boat. Just as the best name for a man is Manny McManface. "
Stephen Colbert,"If they overturn this vote, they're Butty McButtfaces."
Stephen Colbert,"Ben and Jerry from Ben & Jerry's ice cream got themselves into a scoop of trouble yesterday at Capitol Hill protesting against money and politics. The two were arrested — surprisingly, not for the murder of my waistline. "
James Corden,"Coachella was this weekend, and if you don't know what Coachella is, it's a festival where everyone goes to the desert and takes selfies. "
James Corden,"Yesterday was also tax day, and there have been reports from Coachella that concert-goers tried to file their taxes from a makeshift post office at the festival. "
James Corden,"I really feel sorry for the bands, because how bad does a band have to suck for people in the audience to go, ""You know, I'd better go do my taxes."""
James Corden,"It feels like most people aren't even going for the music, they're just going to be seen. There are reports of people spending up to $20,000 on fashion accessories and liposuction for Coachella. I have to say, this is the most L.A. thing that could happen at a music festival."
James Corden,You don't need to get liposuction to feel good about yourself at Coachella. Just do what everybody else is doing to feel better about themselves — drugs.
Jimmy Kimmel,It is primary night in New York tonight. We're still in the primaries — we should at least be in the secondaries by now.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The winner of the New York primary gets delegates, momentum, and most importantly two tickets in the front mezzanine to see ""Hamilton."""
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump had a bit of a stumble yesterday. He was giving a speech in Buffalo and accidentally referred to the devastating terrorist attacks of 7/11 instead of 9/11. Of course, who can forget that fateful day when the Coke-flavored Slurpee machine broke and we were forced to settle for that blue raspberry stuff."
Jimmy Kimmel,Donald has actually been pretty quiet for the last week or so. And I don't like it. It's like when the kids stop making noise. Something's wrong.
Jimmy Kimmel,"In Washington, D.C., yesterday Ben and Jerry, the ice cream guys, were arrested for being part of a political protest on the steps of the Capitol building. But some good did come out of it. They got a lot of new attention for their cause. Also, they got a new flavor of ice cream, which is Toilet Wine Toffee Crunch. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"A popular designer, Marc Jacobs, is trying to get ""#malepolish"" going. Like nail polish but for men. He's posting his painted nails on Instagram and he says he's putting the ""man"" back in manicure. But it really seems like he's putting the ""ick"" back in manicure."
