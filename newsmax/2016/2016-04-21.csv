Seth Meyers,"Now I don't know if you guys are Anglophiles or anything, but if you are, if you are into England, it's Queen Elizabeth's birthday today. She is turning 90 years old. She is the first queen to ever reach that age. There would have been others but they were beheaded.

Seth Meyers,"Queen Elizabeth is having her portrait done by Annie Leibowitz. She's releasing a new stamp in her honor in May. There is a public celebration of her birthday. In June there is a service at St. Paul's plus a big parade — and she gets to wear her birthday tiara all year long.

Seth Meyers,"If you think that you're worried about what is going to happen in this race, just consider Reince Priebus, RNC chairman and man whose name is an anagram for “crisp bee urine.” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"In San Diego near the border of Mexico, the federal agents found a tunnel that is 800 yards long. Which, imagine running a touch down the full length of the field eight times. Thank God for football or I wouldn't have any sense of distance.  "
Jimmy Kimmel,It's the longest cross border tunnel ever discovered. Authorities seized two tons of cocaine and seven tons of marijuana. That means weekend two of Coachella is going to suck. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump said something un-Trumpy this morning. He was on “The Today Show” and Matt Lauer asked him about the transgender law, and whether Caitlyn Jenner would be welcome to use the bathroom at Trump Tower, and Trump said she should be able to use whatever bathroom she wants."
Jimmy Kimmel,Ted Cruz believes that transgender people should hold it in.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Why is this even a thing? Why does this have to be legislated? I mean, really, how many transgendered people can there even be in North Carolina? Five, maybe? Eight tops."
Jimmy Kimmel,Today is National High Five Day.  Derek Smith claimed he came up with the high five while he was playing for the University of Louisville in 1979. That seems wrong because I'm pretty sure Jesus gave high fives after the loaves and fishes thing.
