Seth Meyers,"During his victory speech last night Donald Trump dismissed the idea of facing a contested convention, saying, “As far as I’m concerned, it’s over.” And by “it,” I assume he means civilization as we know it. "
Seth Meyers,"Should he win the nomination, Ted Cruz has selected former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as his running mate. But, unfortunately, he did so by announcing, “Ted Cruz has HP VP!”"

James Corden,There is a new trend in U.K. corporate policy where employees are being given paid time off so that they can acclimate a new pet to their home. They’re calling it “pawternity” leave. You can read more about this story 10 years from now in the book about how China took over the world. 
James Corden,"Paid time off for pets should not be a thing. Here is how that discussion should go: “Excuse me, boss, I want to get a new dog, but I will need a week off to bond with the animal.” And your boss goes, “Oh, OK, cool. You're fired.”"
James Corden,"This makes sense maybe for dogs, but you definitely don't need time off for cats. Cats don't care if you are at home. Cats don't even care if you are alive. "
James Corden,"You don't need a pet to get time off, you could also just move to Venezuela where the president announced today that they are moving to a two-day workweek. And this news is incredible because not only does a two-day workweek sound amazing, I now know one thing about Venezuela. A two-day workweek really does sound great because it makes for the perfect amount of office small talk. Like, day one: “How was your weekend?” Day two: “Any big plans for the weekend?”

Jimmy Fallon,"Pope Francis told thousands of teenagers at mass recently that happiness is not something you can download from an app. That story again, Pope Francis has never seen Snapchat filters."
Jimmy Kimmel,"After all the speculation and the campaigning and craziness and this unprecedented cartoonish election, we seem to be down to two candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. I don't know why. Nobody seems to like them, but they're both way ahead in the delegate count. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"While it's not officially over, it's over. Everyone knows it except Kasich, Sanders, and Cruz. At this point the only chance they have of stopping Clinton and Trump is an angry Beyoncé with a baseball bat, but they're not giving up. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"You almost have to hand it to Ted Cruz. Even though he lost all five primaries, today he named a running mate. He named Carly Fiorina as his running mate. For what, I don't know. Maybe they plan to go running together. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Sanders offered Elizabeth Warren to be his running mate. Bernie said the women of this country understand it would be a great idea to have a woman as vice president. Yeah, or as president, right?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Today the Sanders campaign announced they're downsizing and firing hundreds of people, but he's vowed to stay in the race until the race ends in June or until his life ends. I'm trying to say he's old. There was a miscommunication, I guess."
