Conan O'Brian,"
Donald Trump is now saying that his proposed ban on Muslims was ""just a suggestion."" Then he admitted his presidential campaign is ""just a bar bet.""
"
Conan O'Brian,"Here in California, a white supremacist has resigned from being a Donald Trump delegate. When asked why, the white supremacist said, ""Because that guy's crazy."""
Conan O'Brian,"During the Republican convention in Cleveland, an artist is going to photograph 100 nude women to make a statement. The statement is, ""This is the only way to get people to Cleveland."""
Conan O'Brian,"The FBI just announced yesterday that fewer and fewer Americans are going off to join ISIS. Or as Fox News reported it, ""Once Again, Jobs Drop Under Obama."""
Conan O'Brian,"The producers of the X-Men movies say their next X-Men movie will take place in the 1990s. In it, the X-Men use their superpowers to try and stop the Backstreet Boys."
Conan O'Brian,"At this moment, a 7-Eleven cashier from Connecticut is trying to become the first woman to climb Mt. Everest seven times. She said, ""If I can survive a 7-Eleven hot dog, I can survive anything."""
Conan O'Brian,"Google has created several new emojis aimed at empowering women. So congratulations women, you asked for equal pay and you got five new emojis."
James Corden,"Donald Trump is finally sitting down with his nemesis, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, to discuss unifying the Republican Party after they have been trash-talking each other for months. Ryan is in a difficult spot. On the one hand, Trump has made a lot of offensive statements. On the other hand, Trump is his party's only chance at winning — and because it's Trump, both of those hands are very, very tiny. 

"
James Corden,Paul Ryan right now is like a girl at a bar at the end of the night where all the hot guys have left. So she's trying to convince herself that it would be worth taking home the guy with the orange skin and weird hair. 
James Corden,"But Ryan is not the only one who seems to be changing his mind about Trump. Former presidential candidate John McCain stated this week that he thinks Donald Trump could be a “capable leader.” John McCain spent several years in a Vietnam prison, and now saying “Donald Trump is capable” sounds like the hardest thing he's ever had to do. "
James Corden,"I'm sorry, but saying Donald Trump could be a capable leader is not very reassuring. If you are about to have an operation and they tell you that your doctor could be a capable surgeon, you would be like, “You know what? It was a minor heart attack. I'm good. Don't worry.”

Jimmy Fallon,"We have Drake on the show tonight — a black, Jewish, immigrant rapper from Canada. Or as Donald Trump would say, ""I'm speechless. I need to sit down, I'm getting lightheaded. I'm getting lightheaded. I'm seeing my spirit animal."" "
Jimmy Fallon,"I hate to break it to Donald Trump, but there is already a Broadway show called ""Hairspray."" 

"
Jimmy Fallon,"Burger King just unveiled a new item combining the elements of a Whopper and a hot dog known as the ""Whopper Dog."" As in, ""I've got to take a sick day, I just ate a Whopper Dog."" "

British researchers are warning that one-fifth of the world's plant species are at risk of extinction. Even worse, kale is expected to survive.

Seth Meyers,Donald Trump yesterday began walking back his proposed ban on Muslim immigration and called the plan a suggestion rather than a firm policy idea. In much the same way he doesn't have hair so much as the suggestion of hair. 
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump told the Associated Press yesterday that he had whittled down his list of possible running mates to ""five or six people."" Five or six people is also how Trump describes his kids.  "
Seth Meyers,"""60 Minutes"" correspondent Morley Safer will formally retire this week after 46 seasons with the show. Safer made his name as a young reporter covering the landmark case of ""Asteroid v. Dinosaurs."" "
Seth Meyers,"
Coincidentally, Morley Safer is what Trump says America will be if we build his wall. “Two words: We're not just going to be safer, we're going to be Morley Safer.”
"
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee, but there are a few people he still has to win over. For instance, everyone in the GOP.
 
"
Seth Meyers,"MSNBC had a countdown clock to the meeting this morning where no cameras were allowed and after which we learned nothing. “Jim, can we put up my countdown clock of how much longer we all have to pretend this was news?” That was a long three seconds. "
Seth Meyers,"Of course, when it comes to Donald Trump, there are so many other things that are not happening. For instance, he hasn't picked a running mate, but rumors say he's considering Newt Gingrich. Yes, between them, they've had six wives. "
Seth Meyers,"Apparently, Trump is trying to win the women's vote by marrying them all. If they get elected both the first and second lady will be the third lady. "
Seth Meyers,"It's no secret that I'm fascinated by Gwyneth Paltrow. Not as fascinated as she is, but still. Pretty fascinated. I especially love her lifestyle website Goop, your number one source for $5,000 juicers. "
