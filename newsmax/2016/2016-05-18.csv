Seth Meyers,Bernie Sanders won last night's Oregon Democratic primary and this was a surprise. Hillary came in third — behind a bag of weed. 
Seth Meyers,"
Fox News host Megyn Kelly addressed rumors about Donald Trump's hair in a new interview and said, ""It's not a wig and it's not a comb-over, either."" So, what is it? It's a mystery, wrapped in a riddle, inside an enigma.

Seth Meyers,"
American Express is suing Charlie Sheen for an unpaid credit card balance of over $200,000. How did he blow that much money? Oh, right. Answered my own question.

Stephen Colbert,A new poll has 87 percent of Republicans supporting Trump. The other 13 percent are currently standing on bridges looking vacantly into the distance.
Stephen Colbert,He is slowly unifying the Republican Party. All it took was no other options. 
Stephen Colbert,"In last night's Democratic primaries in Oregon and Kentucky, Bernie won Oregon. No surprise there. If you look at it on a map, Oregon is pretty much as far left as you can get. "
Stephen Colbert,"Meanwhile, in Kentucky, Hillary Clinton declared victory after winning by less than 1 percent. So there's another 1 percent for Bernie to be mad at. "
James Corden,"Recently to celebrate opening in its 100th country, Pizza Hut decided to deliver a pizza to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest point in Africa. I mean this isn't so crazy, whenever I order Pizza Hut I'm usually super high.

James Corden,"You just know that once the guy got to the top, the climbers were like, “Ah, I actually ordered no anchovies, if you could just…”"
James Corden,Burger King has converted one of its restaurants in Finland into a combination of a restaurant and spa. But this is good because now it's perfectly OK to eat a burger during a massage without all that judgment from your masseuse. 
James Corden,"Although I will say if you are the kind of person willing to use a communal sauna as a Burger King, you might be a little too relaxed already.

James Corden,"Wendy's has implemented its own invasion. The company is set to debut computerized self-service kiosks in 6,000 of its restaurants this year. This is actually Wendy's reaction to the minimum wage hike. They're like, “That's it! It's cheaper for us just to build an army of robots than pay Phil a living wage.”"
James Corden,"Now even the robots will be talking about the good old days. They'll be like, “We used to take humans to the moon. Now we work at Wendy's.”"
James Corden,"The idea of robots selling you food may seem scary but don't worry, a lot of things are staying the same. Robots will take the orders, but the food will still be cooked by humans and the bathrooms will still be cleaned by nobody."
Jimmy Fallon,"In a recent interview, ""Shark Tank"" host Mark Cuban predicted that if Donald Trump is elected, it would be bad news for Wall Street. And in related news, Donald Trump just got endorsed by Bernie Sanders. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night, Fox premiered its new reality dating show ""Coupled."" I watched it for 10 minutes and I thought, these two are not going to make it. Then I realized I was watching the Megyn Kelly-Donald Trump interview. "
Jimmy Fallon,"A man from New York proposed to his girlfriend by playing a video on one of the giant billboards in Times Square. It was a beautiful moment until Times Square Elmo said, ""I give it two months.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"
A ""Game of Thrones"" version of the board game Clue is now for sale. It's just like regular Clue except that everyone did it in every room with every weapon. 
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Megyn Kelly interviewed Donald Trump last night. The important thing is that wounds have been healed, which is good. It was difficult to watch Donald and her fight. It's hard to watch a fight between two people with such similar hair styles. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"It seems Donald Trump is integrating himself into the Republican Party establishment, and making amends with those he steamrolled during the race, including the increasingly sleepy Dr. Ben Carson. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders won Oregon. It's funny with Oregon. If recreational marijuana is legal in your state, you can pretty much guarantee Bernie will win it. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Democrats are concerned that Sanders' campaign could alienate enough voters to hand Donald Trump the election. Bernie said, “Listen, I'm 74 years old. I'm surrounded by college girls screaming my name. Don't ruin this for me.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,"
So Clinton won Kentucky and Sanders won Oregon, and now this will be settled by whose supporters can be most annoying on Facebook. Good luck, everybody.
