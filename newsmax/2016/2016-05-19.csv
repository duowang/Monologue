Stephen Colbert,"Ed Rendell tried to help Hillary Clinton by attacking her opponent, saying, ""Trump's comments, like 'you can't be a 10 if you're flat-chested,' will come back to haunt him."" And then Rendell helpfully added, ""There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women. People take that stuff personally."" Yep, I have a feeling a lot of women are about to take that really personally."
Stephen Colbert,"The National Parks Service is so desperate for cash that they just announced that, for the first time, they are going to solicit corporate sponsorship. Pretty soon, those sequoias could be brought to you by Viagra. Remember, if your redwood lasts more than 2,000 years, call your lumberjack! "
Stephen Colbert,"One of the ways that Trump is treating the convention like a reality show is holding off announcing his running mate. As one Trumpling said, ""Announcing the vice-presidential nominee before the convention is like announcing the winner of 'Celebrity Apprentice' before the final show is on the air."" It's an apt metaphor, because this year's Republican convention will be the series finale of America. "
James Corden,"Google has been testing self-driving cars and yesterday they filed a patent for a new safety feature called pedestrian glue. How it works is if the driverless car hits someone, it releases a glue-like coating so that the person will stick to the hood instead of bouncing off."
James Corden,"Now, some car companies might focus on making cars that don't hit people. Not Google. No way. So if one of these cars hits you, you will be spread-eagled, stuck to the hood as the car slowly rolls to a halt, because that was the problem with getting hit by a car before: It just wasn't embarrassing enough."
James Corden,"The driverless car thing seems like it's really catching on lately. In fact, the ride sharing company Uber has begun testing driverless cars on the streets of Pittsburgh. Finally, Uber found a way to make out-of-work actors even more out of work."
James Corden,"But don't worry, for all of you who love Uber, the experience isn't really going to change. To keep in line with Uber's brand, their driverless cars will be programmed to smell like cologne and also make female passengers really uncomfortable."
James Corden,"Honestly, this whole driverless Uber thing is unnecessary. All you have to do now is get hit by one of those Google cars, and just hope it's going where you are going. You'll be fine."
James Corden,"This week a California man recorded his wife giving birth, and accidentally live streamed it to the world on Facebook. I've heard of people on Facebook oversharing, but ovary sharing? "
Jimmy Fallon,"The New York Times just did a big profile on Donald Trump, and revealed that he has life-sized portraits of Ronald Reagan and John Wayne at his campaign headquarters. And if you don't see them right away, it's because they're right behind a 25-foot tall portrait of Donald Trump."
Jimmy Fallon,"For the third year in a row, Washington, D.C., was named the fittest city in American, mainly because Michelle Obama goes around slapping pizza out of everyone's hands."
Jimmy Fallon,"CBS announced that season 33 of ""Survivor"" will be called ""Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen-X."" It'll start in September, and end 20 minutes later when both teams realize there's no Wi-Fi."
Jimmy Fallon,"The Wall Street Journal just reported that America has a surplus of cheese and that every person in the country would have to eat an extra three pounds of cheese this year to get rid of it. So the next time the pizza guy judges you for ordering extra cheese, just say, ""I'm doing this for America."" "
Seth Meyers,"Vice President Joe Biden today urged Americans to have an uncomfortable conversation about race relations. And he would know, because he's had lots of them. "
Seth Meyers,"Despite her promises to be tough on Wall Street, a new report has found that groups supporting Hillary Clinton have received $25 million from the financial industry using so-called shadow banks. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders has received a new waffle iron for opening a savings account. "
Seth Meyers,"According to a new report, Spain's federal debt is now greater than their gross domestic product. Spanish citizens are so upset, they could barely sleep all afternoon. "
