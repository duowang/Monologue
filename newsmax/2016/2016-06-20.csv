Conan O'Brian,"In Beverly Hills it was 108. Of course, because it was Beverly Hills, it only looked 90."
Conan O'Brian,"Donald Trump has dumped his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski said he’s going to return to his old job, as a manager in pro wrestling."
Conan O'Brian,"Even though he has no chance of winning the nomination, taxpayers are still paying for Bernie Sanders to have Secret Service. It’s not that expensive though, it’s just one guy that goes out late at night to buy Fig Newtons."

Jimmy Kimmel,We are in the midst of a hell-like heat wave on the West Coast. The temperature hit 112 in Beverly Hills yesterday. That's dangerous. Many residents of Beverly Hills are made of materials that melt at temperatures like that. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Experts say the best thing you can do in heat like this is take a screen shot of the weather app and post it to Facebook. That way if you die, you go out with some likes."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The basketball game last night was the most watched NBA ever for ABC. The Golden State Warriors seemed to be invincible during the regular season. Before the season started, an evil wizard cast a spell on LeBron that moved his hairline back. The only way to get it back was to win the championship for the city of Cleveland. "
