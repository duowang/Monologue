Stephen Colbert,$1.3 million isn't even enough to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Trump's own building. Not that he would want it. I hear the landlord is a jerk.
Stephen Colbert,"How could Trump have less cash on hand than the ""Veronica Mars"" movie raised on Kickstarter? 
That right there is the kind of mystery only Veronica Mars could solve.
