Jimmy Fallon,"Things are really heating up between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Hillary gave a speech yesterday attacking Trump, and then today, Trump gave a counter-speech attacking Hillary. Which means 2016 will always be remembered as the election of ""Shut up"" — ""No, you shut up."" "

Jimmy Kimmel,Donald Trump has been stepping up his attacks on Hillary Clinton. He just launched a new website called LyingCrookedHillary.com. Which I tried to go on like five times today. Every time I only got a blank page. I told him not to hire the guys who set up the Obamacare website. He didn't listen.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump said the public doesn't know anything about Hillary in terms of her religion, whereas we do know that he is a man of deep faith. In fact, his faith is so deep you can barely see any sign of it. His faith is like one of these see-through fish at the very, very bottom of the ocean. "
