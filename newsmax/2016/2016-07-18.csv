Stephen Colbert,"There was drama this afternoon as the Stop Trump Movement tried to change the rules so they wouldn't be forced to vote for Trump on the first ballot, and when that was unsuccessful, the delegates from Colorado just walked out. And look at what time the Colorado delegates walked out — 4:20, my friends! This is the perfect time to walk out. They might not have been mad. They might have been a little snacky. "
