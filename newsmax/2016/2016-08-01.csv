Seth Meyers,"Many veterans' families are speaking out against Donald Trump after he began attacking the parents of a Muslim-American soldier, calling Trump repugnant. Said Trump, ""I'm the most repugnant. No one is more repugnant than me. Real quick, what does repugnant mean?"" "
Seth Meyers,"After Army father Khizr Khan's convention speech in which he pulled out a pocket-sized copy of the Constitution, sales on Amazon have skyrocketed, making it the second most purchased book. The first is ""How to Move to Canada."" "
Seth Meyers,"A pocket Constitution is perfect for Trump, because it will look regular sized in his tiny hands. "
Seth Meyers,"Trump was asked about his cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin and claimed unbelievably that he couldn't even remember if he'd met Putin or not. Yeah, no offense, but I think I want a president who would remember meeting Vladimir Putin. How many shark-eyed shirtless equestrians do you know? "
Seth Meyers,Mike Pence is finding out that being Trump's VP is like being a fireman who has an arsonist as a roommate. 
Stephen Colbert,A lot of people are talking about Donald Trump and Russia now. And not just because of how much he resembles Russian dressing. 
Stephen Colbert,"This entire campaign, Trump's made us forget about his crazy statements by saying something even crazier. It's the like the old woman who swallowed a fly, only Trump would never be seen with an older woman. "
Stephen Colbert,"The 2016 Rio games start Friday, and there are some concerns. Athletes swimming in the heavily polluted Guanabara Bay have been warned by health experts to keep their mouths closed in the toxic stew. OK? Mouths closed. Or heads out of the water. I can't wait to see who takes home the gold in the Olympic doggie paddle. "
Stephen Colbert,"Last Thursday at the Democratic convention, the parents of a fallen U.S. soldier criticized Donald Trump, and over the weekend, he repeatedly lashed out at them — which got me thinking, is there anyone Donald Trump won't attack if they say bad things about him? "
James Corden,"It's alleged that almost 100 athletes are suspected of using banned substances in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. And they suspect many athletes this year, too, because anyone who wants to go to the Rio Olympics has to be on drugs. "
James Corden,"Ninety-eight athletes in the last two Olympics are suspected of doping, or as it's technically called, ""wanting it more."" "
James Corden,"At this point, they should just make peeing in a cup into an Olympic sport. Just let everyone do drugs. Everyone doing drugs is a fair playing field. What's more exciting than a nine-second 100-meter dash? A three-second 100-meter dash. "
James Corden,"Some sad news today in the world of technology, because it was announced that the last company to commercially produce VCRs, Funai Electric of Japan, will discontinue selling VHS cassette tape players this month. For those of you who don't know what a VCR is, it's that large clock underneath your great-aunt's TV. "
James Corden,"That's right, no more VCRs, which begs the question, how will the CBS audience continue recording our show? But don't worry, if you do enjoy clinging to obsolete relics from the 1980s, you can still just vote for Donald Trump. "
Jimmy Fallon,"There are now less than 100 days left until the presidential election. Or you could say, there are now less than 100 days left ... period."
Jimmy Fallon,"I saw that Apple CEO Tim Cook will hold a fundraiser later this month for Hillary Clinton. He had a long list of terms and conditions for the event, but Hillary just said “Agree!” without really reading them."
Jimmy Fallon,"The summer Olympics start this Friday, and I read that the organizing committee will stay aboard a docked cruise ship called “The Getaway,” which will act as a floating hotel. 'Cuz nothing makes you feel safer about the Olympics than the organizers staying in a getaway boat. “You kids have fun! We’ll just be over here – with the engines running in case things go south.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"A skydiver in California just became the first person to jump out of a plane from 25,000 feet without a parachute and land in a net. Or as Southwest Airlines calls that, “Business Class.” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"The emotional season finale of ""The Bachelorette"" confirmed it is possible to make a lifelong commitment to your soulmate even though you were making out with another guy a simple 24 hours before. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Our hero this year, JoJo, was forced to choose between Robby, former competitive swimmer, and Jordan, former quarterback. She had to choose between the guy who used to play football and the guy who used to swim. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"The New York Post yesterday published several nude photos of Melania Trump that were taken during her modeling days. Trump's communications adviser said the photos are a ""celebration of the human body as art."" To me they look more like a celebration of the human body as a paycheck, but OK — art. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"In any other election, nude photos of the candidate's wife would be far and away the biggest story of the campaign. It would be crazy. For Donald Trump this isn't even a blip. By Wednesday we'll never hear about this again. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"This isn't the first time they've done something like this. I remember many, many, many years back when they pulled the same move with Eleanor Roosevelt. Bernie Sanders has a copy of that hidden under his mattress. "
