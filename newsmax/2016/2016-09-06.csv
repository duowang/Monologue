Seth Meyers,"The president is there for his very last G20 Summit. So, the next time he talks international economics, it'll be with a really bored person at a party."

Seth Meyers,"Have you heard about the latest FBI report on Hillary Clinton's emails? Probably not, because they put it out the Friday before Labor Day. You couldn't hide that news more if you welded it inside a lead capsule and fired it into the heart of the sun. "
Seth Meyers,"One of the big revelations of this latest email dump is that Secretary Clinton didn't use just one smartphone in office as she originally claimed, she used up to 13 different mobile devices in four years. Madam Secretary, tell the truth. Are you a crack dealer? Because I can't figure out why else you would need 13 phones."
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday, in China, President Obama had a meeting with Vladimir Putin. And before they started, Obama texted Michelle: ""Going into a meeting, love you."" While Putin texted the same thing to Donald Trump. "

Jimmy Fallon,"A lot of people were saying President Obama was snubbed by China when they didn't have the stairs ready for him to get off the plane. In fact, Donald Trump said that if that ever happened to him, he'd just close the plane doors and leave the country. Every other country was like, ""That's all we have to do? Thank you. That's perfect!"" "

Donald Trump this weekend, as part of his new initiative to woo African-American voters, visited the Great Faith Ministries Church in Detroit. He said he was there to listen. I don't know what he was listening to but based on his dancing, it clearly wasn't music. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"After three weddings you'd think he'd have learned how to dance. I bet if you asked him if he's a good dancer he'd say, ""Yeah, I'm the best, nobody dances like me."" And it's true, nobody does dance like that."
