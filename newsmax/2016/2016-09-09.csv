Stephen Colbert,"Some disturbing news out of North Korea, they conducted a nuclear test detonating a 10-kiloton device underground. You think it's hard being a North Korean? Imagine being a North Korean prairie dog."
Stephen Colbert,"
North Korea may soon have the technology to nuke countries other than their own because last month they tested a submarine-based missile called the ""No Dong."" The missile flew 300 miles before falling into the Sea of Japan. Man! The dolphins around Japan just cannot catch a break.

Stephen Colbert,"I'd like to take a moment right now to reassure Kim Jong Un. Dear Leader, I want you to know that your ban on sarcasm is a great idea, it's so, SO smart. It doesn't seem desperate AT ALL. And setting off a bomb underneath your own country? Genius! "
Stephen Colbert,"By the way, that haircut — amazing! Doesn't make you look anything like a gang leader at a women's prison. "
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump said this week that Vladimir Putin has been a leader far more than our president has been a leader, and he's got a point. I mean, if President Obama was as strong a leader as Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump would be dead by now. That would be the difference. "

Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, who will be moderator for the final presidential debate of election season, said in an interview this week that he doesn't feel it's his job to call out the candidates when they lie. ""Super!"" said Hillary and Donald at the same time.

New York City turned 352 years old yesterday, and I have to say, it smells it. 

"
Seth Meyers,"The movie ""Sully,"" about the miracle on the Hudson, landed in theaters this weekend, which was pretty shocking because it was supposed to land in Charlotte. "

A New York man was arrested this morning after allegedly stealing $600 from the bra of a 93-year-old woman. The woman was like, ""Hey, give that back! I danced my [butt] off for that money.""

Jimmy Fallon,"Fashion Week is in full swing here in New York City. During one interview, Kendall Jenner made the comment that Hillary Clinton might look good in a jumpsuit. Then Hillary said, “Well, hopefully they never find those emails or it’ll be an orange jumpsuit.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"During last night's game between the Broncos and the Panthers, quarterback Cam Newton was spotted on the bench flossing his teeth. Weirdly, that was the moment dudes were like, “I could never make it in the NFL.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"This morning, North Korea claimed it successfully tested its fifth and most powerful nuclear warhead. Kim Jong Un called the test a major triumph, then asked how long it takes eyebrows to grow back. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Vladimir Putin told Bloomberg Businessweek that Russia never interfered with the U.S. election and doesn't plan to. Putin was like, “Trust me – it was hard enough rigging ‘The Bachelorette.’”"
Jimmy Kimmel,Last night North Korea conducted what they claim was a successful test of their biggest nuclear warhead yet. So congrats to them. I'm glad they're finally figuring that out. Will someone please tell Kim Jong Un they like his new glasses and he looks like he lost weight so he doesn't kill everybody on the West Coast?
Jimmy Kimmel,"Don't worry, though. Donald Trump is going to take care of all of this. How do you fight crazy hair? With even crazier hair. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"
I don't know if you saw this but some interesting photos of Donald Trump were released today from the year 2000. There he is [shows photo] at the U.S. Open with his then-girlfriend Melania, former President Bill Clinton and a lady in a Playboy Bunny shirt. How perfect is this photograph? Look at those two bitter enemies sizing each other up. It looks like the first three minutes of a “Girls Gone Wild” video. It represents the United States at its peak. Before 9/11, before ISIS, before ""Celebrity Apprentice"" — just two horny dudes yukking it up with a couple of swimsuit models.

Jimmy Kimmel,"
This is probably why Trump hates Hillary. She ruined this for them. She took his wing man away.
