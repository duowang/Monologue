James Corden,"Protesters rushed the stage during Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte’s performance — or as Ryan Lochte told the press afterwards, some Brazilians tried to rob him at gunpoint while he was dancing."
James Corden,"We’re not even sure what they were protesting, but one thing they did accomplish was making Ryan Lochte even more confused than he is normally. “Whoa, why are these guys so mad at dancing?” "
James Corden,"It’s weird to protest “Dancing With the Stars” because that’s already where stars go as punishment for doing something wrong. The protesters are like, “Lochte must pay!” And he’s like, “Do you think I just did the foxtrot with Cheryl Burke for fun?!”"
James Corden,"There’s been a lot in the news about Hillary Clinton’s recent bout of pneumonia. Hillary herself tweeted about it yesterday, saying just like any sick person, she’s “just anxious to get back out there.” That shows how out of touch Hillary is with regular people. People don’t want to go back to work. Nobody’s in bed at 1 p.m. thinking, “Oh man, I wish I was watching Linda’s PowerPoint on how to fill out my expense reports.”"
James Corden,"Her doctors say she’s doing so well, she’ll be up and deleting emails in no time."
Conan O'Brian,"Hillary Clinton revealed to Anderson Cooper that she has fainted “a few times.” Of course, I think we all get that way around Anderson Cooper."
Conan O'Brian,"A fistfight broke out at a Trump rally yesterday. Or, more accurately, a Trump rally broke out during a fistfight."
Conan O'Brian,"A 700-pound woman is trying to hit 1,000 pounds to reach her goal of becoming the World’s Fattest Woman. Although, she still plans to put “700 pounds” on her Tinder profile."
Conan O'Brian,A new study came out and it claims that women would be better off going to bed two hours before men. The study was paid for by guys who want to watch porn.
Conan O'Brian,Donald Trump will be going on the Dr. Oz show to discuss his health. He will then discuss his immigration plan with Dora the Explorer.
Conan O'Brian,"During last night’s “Dancing With the Stars,” two protesters rushed the stage during Ryan Lochte’s performance. So finally, an assault on Ryan Lochte that really happened."
Conan O'Brian,"During last night’s Rams v. 49ers NFL game, a fan that ran onto the field had more rushing yards than the entire Rams offense. The guy got arrested, so now that we know he can run and has a criminal record, he’s perfect for the NFL."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Protesters interrupted the show “Dancing With the Stars” to protest Ryan Lochte, upset that the Olympic swimmer is part of the competition and they decided to run onstage to tell everyone about it. That tackle, sadly, was the closest ABC will ever get to having Monday night football on the network. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"The men were arrested on suspicion of trespassing or as they call on it “Dancing with the Stars,” tres-paso doble."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I get that the protester wants to see him punished, but I don’t think this guy realizes, being on “Dancing With the Stars” IS his punishment. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Where were these guys when Paula Deen was on the show, when Tom DeLay was on the show, Warren Sapp, Floyd Mayweather, O.J.? O.J. wasn’t on “Dancing With the Stars?” Well, he will be, with good behavior. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Ryan Lochte himself was a little shaken up. They asked him how he was feeling. He said, “So many feelings are going through my head. No thoughts. But a lot of feelings.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night was the big season premiere of “Dancing With the Stars.” And at one point, two protesters rushed the stage as Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte got his scores. Security stopped them within about 10 seconds, or as Lochte put it, “They kidnapped me, put a gun to my head, and dropped me off at the Grand Canyon!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday Hillary tweeted to her supporters that like anyone who’s ever been home sick from work, she’s just anxious to get back out there. Then those people said, “Nope, we’re pretty happy just staying home and watching Netflix.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday Joe Biden told some of Hillary’s campaign workers that he’s also had pneumonia before, and that if the doctor tells you to take three days off, you should actually take SIX days off. Of course, that advice only really works if your job is vice president. "
Jimmy Fallon,"A spokesman for the Royal Family says that Prince William and Kate Middleton’s upcoming family trip to Canada will be a “largely casual” and “highly outdoors” event. Then normal people said, “So ... camping. You’re going camping.” "
Stephen Colbert,"It has been a rough week for Hillary Clinton. She has been dropping in the polls, and over the weekend, even her immune system turned against her. No surprise — all the white blood cells are voting for Trump. "
Stephen Colbert,Most damaging of all may have been a remark she made at a fundraiser on Friday when describing Trump’s voters as a “basket of deplorables.” Wow. Hillary should put her insults in “the hamper of awkwardness.” 
Stephen Colbert,"It sounds like the worst-selling item at Edible Arrangements. Or maybe your cousin’s suburban punk band. Or even better, maybe the Korean translation of the “Minions” movie."
Seth Meyers,"Following an uproar over her hidden pneumonia diagnosis, Hillary Clinton said yesterday that she just didn’t think it was going to be that big a deal to keep the illness from going public. Sure, when has keeping a secret ever hurt a Clinton? "
Seth Meyers,"According to a new poll, neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump is currently projected to have the necessary 270 Electoral College votes to clinch the election. So you know what that means — a dance off! "
Seth Meyers,"Newt Gingrich commented on Hillary Clinton’s current health concerns last night, and said he is unlikely to trust her medical reports. Oh, but you’ll trust Donald Trump’s doctor? He looks like he got his medical license from a Dave & Buster’s claw machine. "
Seth Meyers,"Bill Clinton tried to dispel rumors yesterday about Hillary Clinton’s health and said that she’s almost certainly in better health than her opponent. I don’t know, Trump definitely has higher levels of vitamins K, F, and C."
