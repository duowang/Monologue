Seth Meyers,"Ahead of tonight’s debate, Hillary Clinton posted an article on Twitter pointing out that no living president has endorsed Donald Trump.  Nice try, Hillary, but it just so happens that Vladimir Putin is living.  "
Seth Meyers,"Madonna reportedly bought her son a Donald Trump piñata this weekend to celebrate his birthday. A Donald Trump piñata is just like a regular piñata, except there’s nothing inside. "
Seth Meyers,"Green Party candidate Jill Stein was escorted off the Hofstra University campus this afternoon after she tried to talk to reporters outside of tonight’s debate without proper credentials. As she was being dragged away by police she shouted, “Don’t you know who I am?” and they said, “No. No one does.”"
Seth Meyers,"We all just watched Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton debate for an hour and a half. Coming into tonight’s debate, Democrats were divided between two strong emotions: panic and pants-crapping. 

"
Seth Meyers,Democrats have not been this nervous since Anthony Weiner asked to borrow their phone. 
Seth Meyers,"Meanwhile, Donald Trump had to not commit murder — on camera."
Seth Meyers,"
Meanwhile, Hillary was so prepared, my new nickname for her is Preparation H. Yeah, it’s a compliment. In the primaries, she already proved she could “soothe the Bern.”
"
Seth Meyers,"Of course, it did not take long for one of these two candidates to tell a lie. [clip of Hillary saying, “Donald, it’s good to be with you.”] False! Where are the fact-checkers? Pinocchio!  "
Seth Meyers,"The debate was moderated by NBC’s Lester Holt, which makes sense since he hosted “Dateline” and is used to two rich white people who want to murder each other "

James Corden,"Tonight was the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and honestly, I meant to watch it, I really did, but right before the debate aired, I was flipping through my DVR and I ended up watching this show called “MacGyver.”"
James Corden,"It is a reboot of the ’80s show. Well, it has everything. It has action. It has adventure. He made a parachute out of the canopy of a truck! [Clip voiceover] “Take one canvas, add some tie-downs, a little wind resistance, you got yourself a parachute.” I mean sure, he got hit by a car afterwards, but it was still awesome."
James Corden,"
There were lots of controversies leading up to these debates, like when Donald Trump accused NBC’s debate moderator Lester Holt of bias, stating that he was a Democrat when in fact, Lester Holt has been a registered Republican the whole time. This is just like how MacGyver thought his girlfriend Nikki Carpenter was a good guy when actually she was a double agent working for the terrorists the whole time. 
"
James Corden,"Based on the post-debate analysis, it sounded like Donald Trump as usual spent a lot of time deflecting the tough questions. Kind of like how MacGyver deflected those bullets with a drink tray. [shows clip] We just knew the waiters happened to be using reinforced stainless steel to serve their cocktails."
Jimmy Fallon,"

Jimmy Fallon,"In addition to costumes, they also banned balloons and drones. Which explains why Trump uninvited Chris Christie and Ben Carson. "
Jimmy Fallon,"A lot of celebrities are sharing their views of the election. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bruce Springsteen called Trump a moron. Which is why now Trump’s starting a rumor that Springsteen wasn’t really born in the USA."
Jimmy Fallon,"A man in Florida is in jail after he was spotted riding a manatee and dared cops to arrest him. Maybe it’s just me, but if you dare cops to arrest you, try to be on a faster animal than a manatee."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tonight the main event from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York: Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton in the first of three presidential debates. It was a long 90 minutes. But the results are in and not a single voter changed their mind. A huge waste of time. It’s very hard to believe that there are still undecided voters. The choice is pretty orange-and-white. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"
The experts said in order to win, Hillary Clinton had to project an image of competence, experience, wisdom, health, and vitality, without coming off as angry, bookish, or overbearing. Donald Trump had to not mention his [genitals]. 

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"This was expected to be the most-watched debate ever. The ratings were expected to rank up with the finale of “Cheers,” the finale of “M.A.S.H.” Makes sense, in a way this election feels like the series finale of America. "
