There was big uproar on the internet last night when Rob Kardashian posted Kylie Jenner’s phone number on Twitter to all of his 7 million followers. Rob said he did this because he was angry that the Kardashian family didn’t invite his fiancée to a baby shower. I cannot think of something nicer than not getting invited to a baby shower.

This week a woman came home from a vacation in Florida to find the two burglars who had ransacked her house were still there having sex on her couch. The woman came home to find valuables missing and an orgy in her living room — that is normally called Airbnb.

James Corden,"If you ever wondered why your grandmother is so particular about covering her sofa in plastic, now you know. "
James Corden,"Lord knows what she is going to do with all the stuff they didn’t steal. Do you know what I mean? I would say if you are walking through today, I would think twice about grabbing that free couch that has been left on the sidewalk. "

According to Forbes magazine, Donald Trump’s wealth is down $800 million from last year. He’s only worth $3.7 billion now, and I’ll tell you something, Mexico is going to pay for it.

Jimmy Kimmel," 
Yesterday was National Register to Vote Day. Singer Katy Perry got naked and told people to vote. The video got like 6 million views already. Hopefully it encouraged people to sign up. But here’s the thing: Anyone who needs Katy Perry to take her shirt off in order to register to vote should not be allowed to register to vote. 
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s our responsibility as Americans to register to vote, to go to our local polling places, and make a choice between two people nobody can believe are our only available options."
Jimmy Kimmel,"IMDb, which provides information about movies and TV shows, will no longer be allowed to include an actor’s age as part of their biography. Which is great news for people who have never heard of Wikipedia where you can get that information immediately. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"
What an important new law! I’m glad actors can now have their lawyers remove their ages from IMDb. Until now all they’ve been able to do is have their doctors remove it from their faces.
