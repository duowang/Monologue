Seth Meyers,"
Donald Trump spoke at a rally yesterday and told supporters that Hillary Clinton’s campaign is the most unserious campaign in American history. Unserious? This is the person you’re calling unserious? [shows photo of frowning Hillary] She always looks like you just told her you wrecked her car.

Seth Meyers,"In an interview yesterday, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson was unable to name any world leaders when asked who his favorite head of state was. Wow. This might have cost him the election. "
Seth Meyers,America Online founder Steve Case endorsed Hillary Clinton for president today. Although the last thing Hillary wants to hear is “You’ve got mail.”

Seth Meyers," 

This Friday internet star Grumpy Cat will join the Broadway cast of “Cats.” A guy who’s going to see “Hamilton” was like, “I can’t wait.”
"
Seth Meyers,"We are still trying to figure out who won Monday’s presidential debate. Democrats say Hillary won, while Republicans are strong in their conviction that there are still two more debates. "
Seth Meyers,"Secretary Clinton is still struggling with millennials. By the way, if you’re not sure who millennials are, they’re the ones who never use the term “millennials.” "
Seth Meyers,"A recent poll shows Clinton has the support of just 31 percent of likely voters under 35. So Hillary’s doing everything she can to attract young people. That’s why, for the first time since July, she appeared on the campaign trail this week with that millennial heart-throb, Bernie Sanders. "
Seth Meyers,"
Bernie! They really like him. He really connects with millennials, because a lot of his clothes are also 18 to 30 years old. 
"
Jimmy Fallon,Hillary Clinton actually went to her granddaughter’s second birthday party instead of preparing for the first debate against Trump. I guess she figured being around a bunch of screaming toddlers might help her even more. 
Jimmy Fallon,"While speaking to students at the University of New Hampshire yesterday, Hillary Clinton said, “Isn’t this one of the strangest elections you’ve ever seen?” And then college kids were like, “Uh, we’re 18.
It’s the ONLY election we’ve ever seen.” 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"
Bernie Sanders is also campaigning with Hillary. Yesterday, he asked a crowd at one of her rallies, “Is everybody here ready to transform America?” Followed by his next question, “Does anybody here remember where I parked?” 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"
Donald Trump is reportedly angry that his advisers are saying that he struggled during the first debate. Then his advisers were like, “Oh, so you CAN hear us.” 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"
This week, a woman in Tennessee walked into her home and found two burglars having sex on her couch. When they tried to run away, she yelled, “At least steal the couch!” 

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"According to the FBI, foreign hackers have made several attempts to breach voter registration websites in the United States with an intent to influence the outcome of the election or steal personal information. The FBI warned that that, quote, “Bad actors have been repeatedly trying to hack us.” It could be a number of suspects — Russia, China, Steven Seagal. Could be Matt Damon. There are a lot of bad actors out there. "
Jimmy Kimmel,The director of the FBI is warning individual states to make sure their dead bolts are thrown and locks are on. They’re using dead bolts and locks to secure voter registration websites? Maybe that’s the problem right there. Those are for bicycles. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Meanwhile, Donald Trump has a new scandal to deal with today. According to Newsweek, in 1998 he spent $68,000 on a business venture in Cuba. Which was illegal because of the embargo. Trump, of course, denied the allegations. He said there’s no such place as Cuba."
Jimmy Kimmel,Remember when Mitt Romney almost had to drop out of the race because he put his dog on the top of the car? They were simpler times.
