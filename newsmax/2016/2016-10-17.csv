Stephen Colbert,"The election continues to be insane. Ever since the tape of the Billy Bush Locker Bus came out, Trump has been fending off attacks like a woman meeting Donald Trump."
Stephen Colbert,"Donald Trump tweeted that the “election is absolutely rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary — but also at many polling places. Sad!” Yes, even at polling places, the election is being rigged against Trump. I heard that on Nov. 8th, millions of “riggers” will be behind curtains in private booths, and with a secret ballot, collude to defeat Trump. "
Stephen Colbert,And why? They’re doing it for the stickers. “I Rigged.” I think that’s what it says; I’m not entirely sure.
Stephen Colbert,"Trump has tweeted multiple times about the media rigging the election, and he’s right. From day one, the media rigged this election — in favor of Donald Trump. You can’t turn on the TV without seeing Trump. He’s like the Geico gecko, but more cartoonish. "
Stephen Colbert,"On Saturday, Trump said that Hillary might be using drugs to help her performance in the debates. Remember what she said about her debate strategy: “When they go low, we get high.”"
James Corden,"Donald Trump is telling his supporters the voter turnout will be manipulated by the Democrats on November 8th. Then again, this is coming from the guy who said, “Make sure you get out and vote November 28th.”"
James Corden,"No matter what happens on November 8th, or the 28th, or whenever the election is happening, Trump apparently has a contingency plan — because now it seems Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is in talks to create a Trump media network. Could you imagine Trump being on your TV 24 hours a day? That would be like — well, it would be like right now. "
James Corden,It means Billy Bush is going to be back on TV in no time.
James Corden,This will probably be a news network. Trump News: It’s for people who love the news but feel like it’s not being yelled at them loud enough.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump, you really have to hand it to him, I don’t think I’ve been this interested in a show since the first season of “Lost.” Every week, a completely new twist. We’ve gone from Mexicans to Muslims, little hands to Lyin’ Ted, Megyn Kelly to Melania’s speech, Crooked Hillary’s health to Billy Bush’s bus. Now he’s saying the election is rigged, even though it hasn’t happened yet. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump spent the weekend campaigning and complaining. He’s been cam-plaining.
Jimmy Kimmel,"As you know, Trump is being accused of sexual misconduct by a slew of women. Of course, that is a case of “he said” and “she said, she said, she said, she said, she said.”"
