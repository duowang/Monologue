James Corden,"We would be remiss if we didn’t start off by wishing Hillary Clinton a happy birthday. It must be tough being a close friend of Hillary. I mean, no matter what you get Hillary Clinton for her birthday, it will never be as good as the gift Billy Bush gave her. "
James Corden,"Hillary’s birthday party is just like any other birthday party except when people yell “speech, speech,” she charges them $250,000. "
James Corden,"Last night was game one of the World Series, the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago Cubs, and it was a shutout. The Cubs never even scored. They should change their name to the James Cordens in High School."
James Corden,"Cubs fans believe that they’ve been cursed since 1945 when a guy tried to bring his goat Murphy into the stadium but was denied because of the goat’s foul odor. To be clear, they didn’t let the goat in not because it was a goat but because it smelled bad. That is how long it’s been since the Cubs were even in the World Series — goat admittance was on a case-by-case basis. "
James Corden,"Last night Taco Bell did a promotion where if a player stole a base, everyone in America would get a free Doritos Locos Taco. And this is a great way for both players and fans to get a lot of runs."
James Corden,"The ride share company Uber announced a promotion this week called Uber Health where people can use their app toward a free flu shot. So yeah, if you don’t mind a high-tech company known for tracking people’s movements injecting you with a random substance, this is for you. "
James Corden,"When Uber drivers were asked today if that why they had a syringe in the glove box, they were like, “Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, the flu shots. Uh-huh, the flu shots.”"
James Corden,"Imagine how terrified you would be if you meant to call a regular Uber and suddenly a guy gets out of the car and says, “Drop your pants, this is going to take a minute.”"

Jimmy Kimmel,"This is night two of the World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians. The Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908. The Indians haven’t won since 1948, which means it will be a very big deal if either team wins. It will also be a very big deal if neither team wins. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump was on the Herman Cain radio show yesterday criticizing, of all things, wind. He said he’s against wind turbines because they’re killing eagles and thousands of other birds. Like Bob Seger, he’s against the wind. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"I happen to know why Donald Trump is against wind power and I’ll tell you, it’s not because it kills birds. Donald Trump is against wind because of what it does to his hair. "
Jimmy Kimmel,Bill Clinton is trying to figure out what his official title would be if his wife becomes president. Hillary has said that she likes the term first gentleman. She hasn’t been able to say it without laughing but she likes the term. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Bill has suggested first volunteer, first dude, and first laddie. If I had a vote I would go with the first lady’s man."
Jimmy Fallon,"Happy birthday to Hillary Clinton, who turned 69 years old today — while Donald Trump said, “The media is reporting that today is Hillary’s birthday, but a lot of people are telling me that it’s actually MY birthday. Rigged!”"
Jimmy Fallon,Hillary’s press secretary posted a photo on Twitter of the staff surprising Hillary with a cake for her birthday. It was really fun — you could hardly tell that Hillary had spent two hours practicing her “surprised” face.
Jimmy Fallon,"Hillary went to a fundraiser here in New York City that was attended by Stevie Wonder. And even Stevie was like, “Let me guess — loud pantsuit?” "

First off, everybody is more fascinated with sex than public policy. If you’re not, there’s a pill for that now."
Stephen Colbert,"But the thing is, Megyn “Kelly File” isn’t talking about fun-time, bedroom whoopee-making. She’s talking about assault. Wait, unless Newt doesn’t know the difference? Maybe no one gave him the talk. Hold on, let’s do this: “Newt, sweetheart, you’re growing up so fast. In fact, you’re 73. Your body’s changing.”"
Seth Meyers,"Happy birthday to Hillary Clinton, who turned 69 today. She made a wish, and then deleted the candles."

Seth Meyers,"Trump supporter Newt Gingrich last night accused Fox News’ Megyn Kelly of being “fascinated with sex” by continuing to report on women accusing Donald Trump of inappropriate behavior. Newt, there’s a difference between being “fascinated by sex” and being “horrified by sexual assault.” It’s kind of like Beyoncé and Rihanna — everyone knows the difference except old white men."
Seth Meyers,Microsoft announced a free update to Windows today that allows users to take photos and edit them in 3D. Critics are calling it “the most exciting thing you’ll ever explain to your grandma.”
Seth Meyers,A school in California is testing a new program that forgoes traditional teachers and has students teach and grade each other’s classwork. So good luck to the students at “Straight A’s Academy!”
