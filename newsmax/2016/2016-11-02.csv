Conan O'Brian,"Wednesday night at the Apollo is usually amateur night, but since our show is here tonight, we’re going to aim lower than that — and we will hit it! "
Conan O'Brian,"What an insane week this is. The Cubs may win the World Series, Donald Trump may be elected president, and the whitest man in America is on stage at the Apollo! It’s officially the end of days, ladies and gentlemen. This was prophesied in the Bible."
Conan O'Brian,"The rumor now is that there’s a Donald Trump sex tape. Yes! In response, Trump is saying, “Vote for me or I’ll release it. “"
Conan O'Brian,"Yesterday, in a speech, President Obama said that when voting, young men should look deep inside themselves. So, as of an hour ago, the front-runner is Kate Upton. "
James Corden,"It was National Stress Awareness day today and due to the election, plenty of people have something to be stressed about. In fact, when asked on a scale of one to 10 how stressed they are right now, most voters punched the pollster in the face. "
James Corden,"If you think it is stressful for you, at least you can vote. I’m British. I’m on the sidelines. To me, this is just the most important season of “The Bachelor” ever. Give her the rose, America. "
James Corden,"Now a lot of voters’ stress has been caused by the bombshell FBI Director James Comey dropped on Friday when he said he was going to investigate more emails on Hillary’s private server. Trump’s feeling so sure of himself now that he actually asked early Hillary voters in Wisconsin to change their vote if they have “buyer’s remorse.” Yeah, and if anyone knows about buyer’s remorse, it is the guy who gets remarried every few years."
James Corden,"In fact, buyer’s remorse is the only thing that anyone learned from enrolling at Trump University. "
James Corden,"If anyone has buyer’s remorse, it’s the Republican Party, isn’t it? They’re like, “Can I exchange this Trump for a Marco Rubio? What’s that, you only have a Ben Carson? Don’t worry, we’re fine.”"
James Corden,"No matter what side you’re on, people are stressed about what’s about to happen after the election. In fact, things have gotten so crazy that Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman, tweeted: “On Nov. 8, I’m voting for Trump. On Nov. 9, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket.” To be honest, it is just nice to hear a Republican saying is he going to grab something that’s not part of a woman. "
Jimmy Fallon,"A new poll finds that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a statistical tie just a week from Election Day. But on the bright side, at least Trump’s finally in a tie that was made in America. "
Jimmy Fallon,"A pair of tickets to tonight’s Game 7 sold on StubHub for almost $40,000. And the couple still left in the seventh inning to beat traffic. “Get your purse, Linda, we’ll catch the end on the radio.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have run national commercials during the World Series games, marking the only time Cubs and Indians fans were booing at the same time. "
Jimmy Fallon,"

Apple’s new iOS update actually changed the peach emoji so that it no longer looks like a cartoon butt. 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"A tech blogger in California used a weather balloon to drop an iPhone from the edge of space, at 100,000 feet in the air, to see what would happen — and still, somehow the phone landed in the guy’s toilet. "
Seth Meyers,Former Congressman Anthony Weiner has reportedly checked into rehab for sex addiction after his numerous sexting scandals. Weiner has asked for privacy and also the Wi-Fi password. 
Seth Meyers,"After the KKK’S official newspaper endorsed Donald Trump yesterday, the campaign released a response calling the paper “repulsive, also their crossword puzzle is way too easy.” [shows crossword with letter “K” in every square] "
Seth Meyers,"A recent study found that always letting children win games in competitions could damage their ability to learn. Which is scary, because [shows picture of pouting Trump] we’re six days away from letting the biggest child win the biggest game. "
Seth Meyers,"In anticipation of her victory, Hillary Clinton has reportedly planned a fireworks show over the Hudson River for election night. Oh god, remember how excited she got over balloons? What’s she going to do if she sees fireworks? "
Seth Meyers,"
A lot of Democrats are blaming [the tightening race on] FBI Director James Comey’s bombshell announcement last week that Huma Abedin also uses email. We didn’t know. Nobody knew! It was a shocker. 
"
Seth Meyers,"
It looks like the FBI is trying to hurt Hillary’s campaign, which has a lot of people upset. Mostly Russia. That’s THEIR gig.
"
Seth Meyers,"And now, the FBI just released documents from their 2001 probe into Bill Clinton’s pardon of shady billionaire Marc Rich. This is a clear breach of protocol. If the FBI is going to release documents from 2001, you do it on Throwback Thursday"
Seth Meyers,"Women on the U.S. Olympic team won more medals than the men, and perhaps most excitingly, Bono has been named the first man on Glamour’s Women of the Year list. You did it, ladies! Congratulations. Women have come so far, now you’re men."
Seth Meyers,"I assume for Bono to be on this list, every other woman has already gotten one of these."
