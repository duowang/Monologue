Seth Meyers,So the Indians lost last night. While other minorities will find out if they lost on Tuesday.

Authorities are investigating why an official FBI Twitter account, that have been dormant for over a year, suddenly posted several tweets praising Donald Trump. Oh, you don’t know why? Well, take your time. I won’t “Russia.” 
"
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump will reportedly hold a small gathering on election night instead of a large celebration, because he is superstitious. Oh, sorry, I read that wrong, “super racist.” "
Seth Meyers,"Former KKK leader David Duke told reporters today that if he’s elected to the Senate, he would be Donald Trump’s most loyal advocate. When asked what he’d do if Trump loses, Duke said, “I’ll burn that cross when we come to it.” "
Seth Meyers,"According to a new poll, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are neck-and-neck in New Hampshire, while Chris Christie isn’t even neck. "
Stephen Colbert,"
The Cubs won the World Series! The curse is lifted. For the first time in a century, Wrigley Field is covered in victory vomit.
"
Stephen Colbert,"Congratulations, Chicago. [whispering] I’m sure you just woke up, so shhh. Lay your head back down on that half-chewed Italian beef and snuggle up to the goat you brought home. You earned it. 

"
Stephen Colbert,"Last night was a storybook extra-innings World Series classic — a lead-off home run, big leads swept away in seconds, rolling out tarps in the bottom of the ninth, five hours of grown men chewing and spitting! Between the rain delay and the gallons of saliva, Joe Madden had to go out to the mound in water wings. "
Stephen Colbert,"After working through all their starters, the Cubs had to swap out their closer, Aroldis Chapman, for this guy, [shows photo] who appears to be Chapman’s 11-year-old nephew who asked to pitch in the World Series for his birthday, but is in fact Carl Edwards, Jr. Congratulations, Carl. "
James Corden,"The FDA is currently debating whether the chocolate hazelnut topping Nutella should be classified as a dessert or a spread. Which is ridiculous. Nutella isn’t a dessert or a spread, it’s a cry for help. "
James Corden,"The Food and Drug Administration is asking people what they use Nutella for, and 37 percent said dessert, 23 percent said as a spread, and 40 percent said they use it as a replacement for their girlfriend."
James Corden,"
Also in the news, last night the Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908. That’s so long ago, the 2016 election hadn’t even started yet. 
"
James Corden,The Cubs went 108 years without winning the World Series. The only drought more epic than that was the one I experienced during college. I’m joking — I didn’t go to college. 
James Corden,"Now, you may have noticed that a lot of times on this show I have taken issue with baseball. I have said some terrible things about baseball in the past. Things like, “I don’t like baseball. I can’t bear it, make the games five hours shorter.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"Congratulations to the Chicago Cubs, who won their first World Series in 108 years. When asked how it was to witness history, Cubs fans said, “I don’t remember.”"
Jimmy Fallon,They mentioned the tarp used during last night’s rain delay was once a poncho worn by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Another big story is that Cubs team president Theo Epstein has now ended World Series droughts for both the Chicago Cubs and the Boston Red Sox. Now, he’s going to take on his toughest job yet, president of RadioShack. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Theo Epstein said last night that he’s going on a month-long bender to celebrate. Hillary Clinton was like, “If you can wait five more days, I’ll join you.” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Last night was the most watched baseball game in 25 years. The Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908. If there were any Cubs fans still alive from the last time they won, they definitely died in the eighth inning."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It was funny hearing all the reporters after the game saying things like the last time the Cubs won the World Series you couldn’t listen to it on the radio because radio hadn’t been invented yet, and the last time the Cubs won the World Series, people weren’t able to clap because we still had flippers. What we now call humans were still evolving from the sea. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Ted Cruz wants to make America great again. Remember the guy everyone wanted to punch in the face? He campaigned on behalf of Trump today, a man who insulted his wife and his father and his face. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Back then Ted Cruz called Trump a sniveling coward, but at a rally with Mike Pence today, he told the crowd he believes Donald Trump is the sniveling coward this country needs right now. Clearly, the man has no principles whatsoever. "
