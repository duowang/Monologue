James Corden,"Last night, the moon appeared larger than normal because it was closer to the Earth. Astronomers call it a super moon. You know what wasn’t super? Any of your Instagram photos of the super moon. "

I have to imagine at this point, the moon is just getting really close so it can look down on us, like, “What the hell is going on down there?!”

Meanwhile back on Earth, Facebook experienced a glitch over the weekend where it accidentally posted death notifications for millions of users who are still alive. Once they saw that their friends died, most people were like, so what do I go with here? The crying face, the angry face? Just a plain old ‘like’ button? 
"
James Corden,"You think it’s bad when your friends don’t wish you a happy birthday on Facebook, imagine when they don’t say anything after you die on Facebook. "
James Corden,"In other news, Donald Trump continued with his White House transition over the weekend, appointing RNC chair Reince Priebus as his White House chief of staff.

James Corden,Rumors are circulating that Donald Trump has been telling his advisers that he plans to spend his weekends in his Trump Tower penthouse in New York City instead of the White House. I don’t think that’s what voters meant when they said they wanted a Washington outsider.

James Corden,"I love that Trump thinks he can just take off back to New York. Just imagine Trump on a Friday afternoon at the White House asking his national security adviser, “Hey, you think this ISIS briefing will be over by 6:00? It’s just I’ve got a thing.”"

Jimmy Kimmel,"Hopefully by now you’ve come to terms with the fact that no matter how much you drink, the results of the election are not going to change. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"
I’ve been having dreams about this election. It’s in my head. Remember when the song “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” just got in there and you couldn’t shake it? It’s like that, except without the “don’t worry” part. 
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Obama held a press conference today, his first since the election. At which every one of the reporters asked him about Donald Trump. A few of them tried to get Obama to say something insulting about Trump but he didn’t bite, he was very diplomatic.

Lowercase."
