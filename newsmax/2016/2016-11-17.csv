James Corden,"If you have a loved one who is still smoking now, now is a great time to help them quit. Then again in two weeks. And then again right after Christmas, the holidays are always stressful. Then there’s New Year’s Day . . . "
James Corden,"There’s exciting news from the world of technology, experts say that in the future sex with robots will become so popular that it could replace sex with humans by 2050. So, basically, in the very near future, instead of texting “U up?” you’ll be texting “U on?” "
James Corden,"Apparently this will even go beyond sex, and you’ll actually be able to seduce the robots. What? The whole point of having sex with a robot is that you don’t have to seduce it! I don’t talk my microwave into heating up my coffee. “I’m going to put this cup of coffee inside you for about 90 seconds, OK? And I want to you get real hot!”"

James Corden,"A study published in the journal Menopause revealed that as they age, women tend to have better memories than men. There is no way this is true.

We try to encourage those of you on Facebook to decide which of your Facebook friends are actually friends and eliminate those who don’t make the cut. My mission is to simplify your life and to bring meaning back to the word “friend,” which has been cheapened. Also I like saying the word “NUD.” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s the social media equivalent of cleaning out your fridge. That guy who sat behind you in freshman biology class who keeps posting about his 5K, he’s a container of old beans. Throw him out today. That woman from accounting who posted 30 pictures of her bird today, she’s a tub of cream cheese that has green forming on it."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Unfriend every classmate, co-worker, neighbor, every lady from church who you don’t know who has ever annoyed you. I won’t be happy until you log into Facebook and see a blank white screen, and that’s the goal. Today is not the day to make friends. "

Stephen Colbert,"
Trump’s transition continues its transitioning. Don’t know a lot about what’s going on, but I do know that his team has not yet called the Pentagon, possibly because he knows more than the generals. Or maybe he’s never going to call them. He’ll just launch a literal tweet war: “@Pentagon, please bomb Syria. #LyingNewYorkTimes.” 
"
Stephen Colbert,"
Trump doesn’t even believe in the existence of global warming, having tweeted: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,” and calling global warming “very expensive BS.” Of course, “Very Expensive BS” is also the motto for Trump University. 
"
Stephen Colbert,"Chinese officials have responded to Trump’s accusation with a strongly-worded statement, and I’m going to read this in the original Mandarin: “Nuh-uh.” I hope I’m pronouncing that correctly."
Stephen Colbert,"They added that the Chinese will continue to fight climate change, quote, “whatever the circumstances.” Just hold on — things have gotten so bad now that China is telling us to care about the environment?! Have you SEEN Beijing? No, you haven’t, because it’s hidden behind their air. "
Seth Meyers,"Hillary Clinton made her first appearance since the election last night and told the crowd, “There had been a few times this past week when all I wanted to do is just to curl up with a good book or our dogs and never leave the house again.” Oh, sure, NOW you’re relatable.

"
Seth Meyers,"Nissan is now offering a limited-edition version of its Rogue SUV to promote the new movie “Star
