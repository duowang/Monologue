James Corden,"The Dakota Access oil pipeline, which the Sioux tribe has been protesting for months, will no longer be routed through their land. It’s a big win for Native Americans — and if the next 9 billion things go their way, we can finally call it even. "

Jimmy Kimmel,"Ben Carson, in case you don’t know, is a former neurosurgeon with no experience in Housing or Urban Development. This is the first time the phrase “Well, it’s not brain surgery” is actually a bad thing."
Jimmy Kimmel,Why would he get this job? He’s a medical doctor. I feel like Donald Trump just heard the word “urban” and nominated the first black friend he had. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump’s been busy assembling his Cabinet. His nominees are all pretty out there. As of today, the least-controversial person in his Cabinet is a guy named “Mad Dog.”"
