Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump this weekend will give his first Sunday morning news interview since the election, and it’s a big sacrifice for him because Sunday morning is usually when he tweets about “Saturday Night Live.” "
Seth Meyers,"During Trump’s Sunday morning news interview, he is expected to discuss the agenda for his first 100 days in office. Trump was like, “Wait, I have to be president for a hundred days?”"
Seth Meyers,"Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters today that Donald Trump is a huge Elton John fan. “That can be cured,” said Mike Pence. "
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump’s team is reportedly desperate for an A-list celebrity to perform at his inauguration, with one official saying they can “do better than Kid Rock.” Besides, Kid Rock is going to be too busy with his new job as secretary of state. "
Seth Meyers,"Check one’s calendar because right now we are 43 days from the inauguration, and Donald Trump continues to fill out his Cabinet. Watching Trump pick these people is like watching your Nana get a sponge bath — you know it has to be done, but it’s upsetting. "
Seth Meyers,"Yesterday, Trump named Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma attorney general and sworn enemy of the EPA, to be the head of the — what’s the word? — the EPA. I would change my phone number, or else he’s going to get some pretty angry calls from himself."
Seth Meyers,There is a trend of Trump appointing people to head things they’re against. I’m looking forward to Surgeon General Joe Camel. 
Seth Meyers,"So, what kind of EPA head will Pruitt be? Well, he’s repeatedly explained that he thinks the states are in the best position to regulate local industries. Makes sense. If Missouri dumps chemicals into the Mississippi River, they just tell those chemicals, “Remember, you stop at the Arkansas state line.”"
Conan O'Brian,"For the second year in a row, Johnny Depp has been named Forbes magazine’s Most Overpaid Actor. After hearing this, Nicolas Cage said, “What do I have to do?”"
Conan O'Brian,Starbucks has come out with a new Frappuccino that’s named after Pokémon Go. They’re saying it has “the taste of something you lost interest in around September.”
Conan O'Brian,"For his secretary of labor, President-elect Trump has picked an executive from the fast food restaurants Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Afterwards, Trump admitted he made the choice on an empty stomach."
Conan O'Brian,"Everyone’s OK, but this morning, a 6.5-magnitude earthquake hit California’s prime marijuana-growing county. Authorities swept the area, urging residents to remain even calmer."
Conan O'Brian,"Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said she cannot take a position in the Trump administration because she has four young children. She said, “This would mean taking care of one more.”"
James Corden,"It’s that time of year when people like to cozy up next to their loved ones near the fire — until Sunday, that is, because according to a recent study of social media, Dec. 11 is the day when are you most likely to be dumped by your boyfriend or girlfriend."
James Corden,"Great, just another thing to put on your list of things to do for the holidays. “Let’s see — shopping’s done, presents are wrapped, what’s left? Oh, yeah! Mark, we need to talk.” "
James Corden,"But you know why people do this? They’re going to the mall to buy a present, circling the parking lot a couple of times looking for a spot and thinking, “Oh, I’m just going to break up with her.” Either that or these breakups are happening after conversations like “I can’t wait for you to meet my dad. He is a little overprotective but he is so excited to show you his gun collection.”"
James Corden,"Why not simplify your holiday season? Combine the breakup with the Christmas gift. “So I hope you like what I got you, it’s a Match.com membership.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"This weekend is SantaCon, which is the annual bar crawl where people dress up like Santa Claus for a day of drinking. That’s right, a drunken bar crawl wearing a Santa suit, or as the real Santa calls that —December 26.

Jimmy Fallon,A growing trend among families is giving their kids a few small presents ahead of Christmas to break up the tension of getting everything on Christmas Day. They actually have an interesting name for this — Hanukkah. 
Jimmy Fallon,"I heard that putting cinnamon and nutmeg into your baked goods for the holidays can actually reduce stress. Then certain other people were like, “I know something else you can put in your baked goods. Marijuana, dude!” "
Jimmy Fallon,"David and Victoria Beckham’s 11-year-old son Cruz just released his first single, called “If Every Day Was Christmas.” I’m pretty sure if you’re the son of David and Victoria Beckham, every day is Christmas. “I have my own butler and I’m quite good looking. Merry Christmas. I own a stadium.” I can’t relate to that song. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Christmas is coming. Yes, I do mean that as a threat. Christmas is that magical time of the year when Mariah Carey makes a billion dollars in residuals in two weeks. It is a good song, but I mean, really. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Congratulations to Mick Jagger, who just became the father of a baby boy. His eighth child. His oldest child is 46 years old. Mick Jagger himself is 73 years old. They say the baby looks just look his dad, all wrinkly. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"According to a statement from his publicist, Mick was at the hospital for the arrival. I like that they had him “for the arrival.” He is 73, he could have been at the hospital for a lot of reasons. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Hillary Clinton made her first public appearance on Capitol Hill since that whole election thing today. She was in town to honor outgoing Nevada Sen. Harry Reid and, what an impression. She showed up in black leather from head to toe, like Olivia Newton-John in the final scene of “Grease.” Incredible. "
