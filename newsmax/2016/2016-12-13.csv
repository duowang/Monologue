Seth Meyers,They ended their meeting with a bro hug in front of the cameras. I heard these two are going to drop an album together. It’s called “The Deportation of Pablo.”

Seth Meyers,"Tillerson is an interesting pick. For one thing, he’s an oil main who believes in climate change. Well, of course he believes in it! He’s from Exxon — he INVENTED it. It’s pride of ownership. It’s his baby!"

James Corden,"The big story today was Trump’s meeting with Kanye West. The two met in Trump’s apartment and then took photos and answered questions in the lobby. When asked what they talked about, Trump had kind of a weird answer: “We’re just friends.” Just friends? What happened up in that apartment? "
James Corden,"What could these two have to talk about? I can’t think of anything they could possibly have in common. They’re completely, totally different people from two different worlds. I mean, Trump goes on these crazy Twitter rants at 3:00 a.m. and Kanye — well, he also does that all the time."
James Corden,"But one of them famously appears on a huge reality show and the other one — OK, yes, he was also on a huge reality show. "
James Corden,"One of them is constantly claiming that awards shows are rigged and the other — OK, that’s also a bad example. "

Jimmy Kimmel,Donald Trump met with Kanye West today — what an amazing thing to see. Our next two presidents side by side. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Kanye tweeted, “It’s important to have a direct line of communication with our future president if we truly want change.” Yeah, that’s great for you, but what about us?"
