James Corden,"A man in Vietnam was hospitalized after doctors realized that he had a pair of scissors in his digestive system that had been left there by a previous surgery that he had 18 years ago. I mean this guy is so lucky. Come on, free scissors!"
James Corden,"The sad part is after they sewed him up the second time the doctor was like wait, ""where's my watch?"""
James Corden,"If you feel bad for the guy who didn't know he had scissors inside him, imagine being the guy standing behind him in the TSA line."
James Corden,"Amazingly, he rarely suffered any pain over those 18 years. But from time to time he did get a bit snippy."
Stephen Colbert,"we're a little over two weeks from Trump's inauguration. Typically, you've got a bunch of stars there at the inauguration to perform for the new president. Reagan had Frank Sinatra, Clinton had Fleetwood Mac, George W. Bush had Ricky Martin, Obama had Beyonce. So, obviously, for Trump, everybody who's anybody is going to be there, except for anybody. Because he's having a wee bit of trouble getting famous acts to perform. "
Stephen Colbert,"Turns out the Mormon tabernacle choir is scheduled to perform, but over the weekend, a choir member resigned because she didn't want to perform for Trump. Now the choir needs to fill that empty spot with a Mormon who has free time and can sing â€” Trump has a job for Mitt Romney after all!"
Stephen Colbert,"Bill and Hillary Clinton will attend Trump's inauguration. I think that's very nice that she's being a gracious loser. And if you count the popular vote, a gracious winner. "
