James Corden,"We want to start by talking about L.L. Bean, the outdoor clothing company. They were the focus of a boycott this week after it came out that one of the company’s co-owners, Linda Bean, had donated a lot of money to support Donald Trump. When Trump found out about the boycott, he just let it go and moved on. "
James Corden,"I’m kidding, he tweeted about it. He thanked Linda Bean for her support and then he commands everybody to buy L.L. Bean. I for one am shocked that the co-owner of a company founded by a hunter, to sell hunting boots to other hunters, would come out in favor of a Republican. "
James Corden,"A lot of people were upset that an L.L. Bean family member was connected to the Trump campaign, and I hear that L.L. Bean’s brother Cool J is absolutely livid. "
James Corden,"So Donald Trump endorsed L.L. Bean on Twitter — because if anybody represents the rugged great outdoors, it’s a spray-tanned germaphobe who goes to the bathroom on a gold toilet. "
Conan O'Brian,"The CIA is now saying that the Kremlin has multiple sexual recordings of Donald Trump. After hearing this, Trump smirked and said, “Yeah, all from the same night… #stamina.”"
Conan O'Brian,"Today, the San Diego Chargers announced they are moving to Los Angeles. The owner of the Chargers said, “What can I say, we really loved ‘La La Land!’”"
Conan O'Brian,"It’s raining so hard now, we’re actually having mudslides here in L.A. This morning I was driving to work and I was passed by a house."
Conan O'Brian,"Good news, the five-year drought is over. That’s right — last night, I had sex."
Conan O'Brian,"Donald Trump has named 72-year-old Rudy Giuliani to be his adviser on cybersecurity. Trump explained, “I’m not up to speed on the latest technology, so I wanted to get somebody two years older.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,We have another NFL team in L.A. The San Diego Chargers have announced they will be known now as the Los Angeles Chargers. Two teams is a lot of teams. I was ready for some football. I don’t think I was ready for this much of it. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Reaction from fans here in L.A, I don’t know if I’d call it mixed. They reacted the same way to opening a Bed, Bath & Beyond coupon in the mail. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Meanwhile, in our nation’s capital, our elected officials had a late night of work. After seven hours of debating, they voted to approve a resolution that would rid the country eventually of Obamacare. Can you imagine, the senators finally worked until 1:30 in the morning, and it was for this? How would Congress like it if we all met in the middle of the night and voted to take THEIR healthcare away? "
Jimmy Kimmel,"
If Obamacare is repealed, 20 million Americans could lose healthcare which is a very big deal, but we don’t seem to be as fired up. If they voted to take Netflix away from us, we’d go nuts. We would burn things. It would be crazy.

Jimmy Fallon,"
All of these accusations are coming out about Trump’s ties with Russia. In fact, a 2013 interview just resurfaced where Trump says he has a relationship with Vladimir Putin. While Putin’s like, “Ugh, you poke someone back on Facebook, next thing you know you’re in a relationship.” 
"
Jimmy Fallon,"Yesterday, Trump held his first big press conference since the election, and he got into a shouting match with a CNN reporter who claims that Trump tried to have him thrown out. Then the other reporters were like, “Oh, come on. Why does HE get to leave?” "
Jimmy Fallon,"Now Penthouse is offering a million dollars to anyone who has compromising videos of Donald Trump. When he heard about the offer, Trump provided the videos himself. “I know a good deal when I see one.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"Ben Affleck was patted down by TSA security at Los Angeles International Airport this week. Though when it was over, the woman whispered, “I’m not in the TSA.” "
Stephen Colbert,"President Obama is wrapping things up at the White House. You know, cleaning out his desk, handing over the keys, and spackling over the holes in the office wall so he can get the security deposit back, squeeze a little toothpaste in there. "
Stephen Colbert,"There’s these allegations that Russia has compromising information on Donald Trump. It’s all based on 35 pages of opposition research that was evidently put together by a British MI6 agent. Yesterday, we didn’t know his name, and now we know his name is Steele — Christopher Steele. So, a Brit spy named Steele? Is he Remington Steele’s cousin?"
Stephen Colbert,"I guess secret agent Colt Megaslam was on another assignment. Was superspy Rand Manly not around? Christopher Steele is a really an on-the-nose name for a British agent. Actually, it sounds more a gay porn name. Because it is. [shows photo of shirtless muscular man] Meet Chris Steele, gay porn actor.

Seth Meyers,"President Obama today awarded Vice President Joe Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom With Distinction, which is an honor only three other people have been given over the last 30 years. Then Biden gave Obama his highest honor, double finger guns with a wink. "
