Conan O'Brian,"Over the weekend, Donald Trump sent out angry tweets blasting civil rights legend John Lewis. So I guess we all celebrate Martin Luther King Day differently. "
Conan O'Brian,A Bruce Springsteen cover band is the latest musical act to drop out of performing [at the inauguration]. Yeah. That's right. That's the situation we're in right now. It is not a good sign when a cover band thinks you're not a legitimate president. 
Conan O'Brian,"In an interview yesterday, Donald Trump said he has a replacement for Obamacare that will provide insurance for everybody. Yeah, it's called move to Canada. "
Conan O'Brian,Dozens of Democratic members of Congress are boycotting Donald Trump's inauguration. Which is shocking because I didn't know there were still dozens of Democratic members of Congress. I guessed there were like two left. 
Conan O'Brian,"In an interview, President Obama said that reading books helped him get through difficult times during his presidency. Reading books, yeah. So he said, “Thank you, Judy Bloom.” "
Conan O'Brian,"There's a new app out there that describes itself as Tinder for adopting babies. So one day, siblings will be taunting each other with, ""Ha ha, mom right-swiped you. You shouldn't be here."""
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony is this Friday, which means Mike Pence's is on Monday. "
Seth Meyers,"After civil rights leader John Lewis called Donald Trump an illegitimate president, incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus claimed that Republicans never questioned the legitimacy of President Obama's election. And then President Obama sighed so hard his hair turned white. "
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump tweeted about Martin Luther King Jr. this morning, saying people should celebrate, quote, ""All the many wonderful things that he stood for."" He then quickly logged off before anyone asked him to name one. "
Seth Meyers,"Donald Trump met with Steve Harvey at Trump Tower on Friday. Meanwhile, Trump's toupee and Harvey's mustache met for a play date. "
Seth Meyers,"According to a new report, 67 percent of millennials use Netflix, which must really tick off whoever owns the account they're using. "
Jimmy Fallon,"I saw that Donald Trump himself is selling inauguration sweatshirts for $79. I know it sounds expensive for a sweatshirt, but just imagine how much they would have cost if they were made in America. "
Jimmy Fallon,"I read that  Trump raised a record $90 million in private donations to pay for his inauguration. Trump said, ""Just another $10 million and we can cover my appearance fee."" "
Jimmy Fallon,"I read about a man in Virginia who paid the DMV his $3,000 fine in pennies. It took the workers 12 hours to count them all. And that line still moved faster than the one you were in waiting in at the DMV. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night, ""The Young Pope"" premiered on HBO. You can tell this pope is young because when people say, ""Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned."" He just goes, ""Kay."" "
Stephen Colbert,"Happy Martin Luther King Day, everybody. For anyone who had today off, I hope you celebrated in the traditional way, by sleeping in so you too could have a dream. "
Stephen Colbert,"Donald Trump observed the holiday by visiting the National Museum of African American History, or more accurately, canceling his visit to the National Museum of African American History. Although I guess in a way that might be good. The last thing we need is Trump learning more about segregation."
Stephen Colbert,"Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey is officially cutting down. Apparently, the circus doesn't think it could compete against a Trump presidency. "
Stephen Colbert,It's too bad; the circus employs 500 people who are now sadly packing their things and all getting to a single clown car. This is sad news for every kid threatening to run away and join the circus. And also sad news for every parent with a creepy old-fashioned kid who still says stuff like that.
Stephen Colbert,"Now, the circus won't officially close until May, so if you don’t get a chance to see it, you had 150 years. No one feels bad for you."
