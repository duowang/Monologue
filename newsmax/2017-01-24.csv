Conan O'Brian,"It is true, I’m not making this up, he did call his inauguration day “A National Day of Patriotic Devotion.” So today, Trump was accused of fascism by Democrats and plagiarism by Kim Jong Un."
Conan O'Brian,"The Oscar nominations came out today and the movie “La La Land” got 14 nominations. However, that’s only because 3 to 5 million undocumented immigrants voted illegally."
Conan O'Brian,"A Fox News host claims he saw Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway get into a fistfight at one of the inaugural balls. However, today it was explained to him that “that’s just how Irish people dance.”"
Conan O'Brian,"Engineers have begun trying to find a way to brew beer on the moon. Which means we’ll soon have astronauts calling into Mission Control saying, “Houston, we have a drinking problem.”"
Seth Meyers,"Following President Trump’s inauguration, the White House website no longer has an option for translation into Spanish. So, sorry, Mexican immigrants, if you want to live here, you’ll just have to learn to speak Russian. "

Jimmy Fallon,"ABC will air a primetime special with President Trump tomorrow night, marking his first interview since taking office. Even though the interview hasn’t even aired yet, Trump is already claiming it was watched by a billion people."
Jimmy Fallon,President Trump signed executive orders to continue construction on the controversial Keystone and Dakota Access oil pipelines. I guess he hasn’t seen a massive protest since Saturday and kinda misses it.

Jimmy Fallon,"This weekend’s big box-office winner was “Split,” starring James McAvoy as a man with multiple personalities.

Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump got his first approval rating numbers and they aren’t good. His approval rating stands at 45 percent, which is the lowest in history for a new president. Or as his press secretary Sean Spicer put it today, “The highest in history for a new president.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,The number one thing on Donald Trump’s mind right now is the election in November. He says that 3 million to 5 million illegal voters cost him the popular vote. There doesn’t seem to be any evidence to support this belief but that doesn’t matter.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I’m 100 percent convinced if given the choice, Donald Trump would rather have won the popular vote and lost the actual election than the other way around."
Jimmy Kimmel,The New York Times used the word “lie” to describe the president’s take on this. But I don’t know. A lie is when you say something you know isn’t true. I think Donald Trump believes it. It’s not so much a lie as it is a symptom.
