Seth Meyers,"The Westminster Dog Show has added three new breeds to its annual events. Said the dogs, “Yeah, last year’s after party got pretty wild.” "
Seth Meyers,"Trump’s SCOTUS nominee is federal judge Neil Gorsuch! No surprise he chose him. He is a strict constitutional originalist. That means he rules only as the Founding Fathers intended in cases like “Marbury v. Electricity Is the Devil’s Magic” and “The People v. Slavery Is Cool, Right?”"
Seth Meyers,We’re just 10 days in and it feels like it’s total chaos at the White House. This is supposed to be the honeymoon. How could Trump blow the honeymoon? He’s had three of them. 
Seth Meyers,"Right or wrong, Trump’s immigration ban has been a PR disaster, with heartbreaking stories like the 5-year-old boy who was detained for more than four hours and reportedly handcuffed. AND he’s a U.S. citizen!"
Seth Meyers,"Now this sounds bad, but yesterday White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the detainment [plays clip of Spicer]: “To assume that just because of someone’s age, or gender, or whatever, that they don’t pose a threat would be misguided and wrong.” Yeah, NOT handcuffing a child is a security risk. We all know kids go through stages — you’ve got the terrible twos, the fatwa fives, it’s absolutely terrifying."
Conan O'Brian,"Man, Donald Trump is busy these days, isn’t he? The guy’s been president for, what, six, seven days? And he’s already done 150 things that are [ticking] people off left and right. "

James Corden,"The world’s first supermarket chain to only sell vegan foods, which was called Veganz with a “z,” has announced they will have to declare bankruptcy and shut all their stores. When asked what went wrong, the vegan supermarket said, “Well, we’re a vegan supermarket.” "
James Corden,Turns out you can buy vegetables at any supermarket. But maybe it was destined to fail. Critics say the business plan was weak. Probably from a lack of iron. 
James Corden,"In Massachusetts, federal agents charged a man for money laundering after they found that he had been keeping $20 million under his mattress. Or as we’ll call it after a few years of Trump’s fiscal policy, “a bank.” "

Jimmy Fallon,"Even people connected to Trump are taking some heat, like Disney CEO Bob Iger, who’s facing criticism for being part of a Trump advisory committee. Meanwhile, Aladdin has been stuck in customs at JFK since Saturday. You’d think he’d just take the carpet."
Jimmy Fallon,"A psychologist at Johns Hopkins University says he believes that President Trump suffers from “malignant narcissism.” The condition is actually treatable, but unfortunately, Trump JUST missed the deadline for Obamacare."
Jimmy Fallon,We’re just five days away from Super Bowl 51! And a new poll finds that the majority of Americans want the Atlanta Falcons to win. But lately we’ve learned that it doesn’t really matter what the majority of Americans want.

Jimmy Fallon,BlackBerry just announced that it’s releasing a new phone next month that has a physical keyboard. Experts are calling it the biggest tech news of 2006.
Jimmy Kimmel,I’ve been making a lot of jokes about this presidency becoming a reality show. I did not know the reality show would actually become a reality. 
Jimmy Kimmel,President Trump has nominated someone to serve on the Supreme Court. He was supposed to announce his pick on Thursday but then yesterday he tweeted that he’d made his decision and would announce it live tonight. This is the first time a Supreme Court nomination has ever interrupted an episode of “NCIS.” 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Not only did the White House do everything they could to keep the nomination secret to build suspense, they brought in Trump’s final two choices, Judge Neil Gorsuch from Denver and Judge Thomas Hardiman from Pittsburgh, to see which one — that’s right, [Trump] Ryan Seacrested his choice for the Supreme Court.

Jimmy Kimmel,"The one [staffer] I believe will be leaving first — mark my words, for whatever reason they give, he will be seeking other opportunities by the end of the year — is press secretary Sean Spicer. He is the guy who every day has to get up in front of his colleagues, a room full of reporters who he used to be friends with, to attempt to explain what the hell is going on. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump, as you know, believes he would have won the popular vote had there not been what he says are 3 million to 5 million illegal votes cast. The expert whose work Trump cites as evidence of this is a guy named Greg g Phillips, who according to the Associated Press is registered to vote in three states. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s registered to vote in Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas. You know the saying, in order to stop voter fraud, you have to be willing to commit voter fraud. Maybe he’s going undercover. "
