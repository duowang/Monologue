Seth Meyers,Thousands of flights were canceled today due to a powerful winter storm. Either that or Trump’s new travel ban is for all of us.
Seth Meyers,"President Trump yesterday described the discussions over the Republican health plan as a, quote, “big, fat, beautiful negotiation.” Well, he’s making progress.  It’s the first time he’s ever described anything as fat AND beautiful."
Seth Meyers,"A woman confronted White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer in an Apple Store this weekend.  Not sure where he was in the Apple Store, but safe to say, not at the Genius Bar."
Seth Meyers,"An Oregon man led police on a 10-mile, high-speed chase on Sunday in a stolen street sweeper truck. On the bright side, by the time he was arrested, his community service was done."
Seth Meyers,Police in South Carolina charged a substitute teacher last week for allegedly being drunk while in class. Students realized she was drunk after she kept referring to lunch period as “Miller time.”
Seth Meyers,"We were supposed to get up to 2 feet of snow, but it turned to sleet early — just cold and brittle, right in your face. It reminded me of Kellyanne Conway. "
Seth Meyers,"New Yorkers are flocking to Craigslist looking for a “blizzard buddy.” You know, a blizzard buddy. Somebody to come over for a little Netflix and wind chill. It could be fun. "
Seth Meyers,"One adult video website announced it would donate snow removal services to several cities in the Northeast because it wants to “plow Boston.” Very generous. Very, very generous. I’m not sure I trust the porn industry with city services. I mean, these people can barely deliver a pizza. "
Seth Meyers,"But if this works out, maybe porn companies can take over other government functions, because like the Trump administration, they feature real, live amateurs. "
Seth Meyers,"It came out last night that Rex Tillerson used an email alias while he was CEO of Exxon to discuss climate change on the sly. So in the Trump administration, you can be a sexist, or a white supremacist, but you’re gonna want to keep your science talk on the D.L. "
Conan O'Brian,"The entire Northeast is being hit by Winter Storm Stella, the first blizzard of 2017. Of course, now that Obamacare is getting repealed, it’s nice to see something’s still covering half the country."
Conan O'Brian,"Vladimir Putin is reportedly frustrated by the lack of progress in U.S.-Russian diplomacy since President Trump took office. He’s not happy. In fact, Putin is so frustrated, today he called Trump and threatened to fire him. "
Conan O'Brian,Press Secretary Sean Spicer says that President Trump didn’t literally mean that President Obama wiretapped him. He also said Donald Trump didn’t literally mean for people to vote for him. That was not the idea. 
Conan O'Brian,"Today, President Trump had lunch with a Saudi prince. Trump told the Saudi prince, “We have a lot in common. My wife doesn’t leave the house, either.”"
Conan O'Brian,White House strategist Steve Bannon is under criminal investigation for voter fraud. Reportedly he voted last year in Florida while still technically a resident of 1930s Germany. Can’t have it both ways. 
Conan O'Brian,An Ohio couple was arrested for faking their own murder. People grew suspicious when the couple changed their Facebook status to “We’ve been murdered.” Sad! 
Conan O'Brian,"New research just came out that finds that consuming potatoes and alcohol can lower your sperm count. So, fellas, this St. Patrick’s Day could be our last. "
Conan O'Brian,"By the way, sorry, if that were true, I wouldn’t be alive. I’m one of six kids. There’s no way. That’s all we had. Have your tater! That’s how my parents greeted me every morning — have your tater! And they threw it at me, hit me on the head. "
Conan O'Brian,"Last night was the season finale of ABC’s “The Bachelor.” And tonight is the season premiere of “The Bachelor” spinoff, “Herpes in Paradise.” So check that out. It’s a good one. "
James Corden,White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced yesterday that Donald Trump would be donating his presidential salary to a charity at the end of the year. Credit where credit is due — Trump is getting pretty creative in the ways he’s refusing to pay his taxes. 
James Corden,"Spicer said not only will Trump donate his salary, he would love for White House reporters to determine “where it should go.” Unfortunately, where they suggested it should go is not a place that I can say on television. "
James Corden,"But seriously, how great would it be if the reporters all chose Planned Parenthood? "
James Corden,"Trump’s adviser, Kellyanne Conway, gave a TV interview on Sunday and people noticed that she displays a photo of herself in her living room. This is true. Take a look at the photo just there. Wow, her microwave takes great pictures! "
James Corden,"Who has a framed picture of themselves, on their own, in their living room? She should change her name from Kellyanne Conway to Kellyanne Kanye. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Everybody’s talking about this giant storm. It’s the huge blizzard that hit the East Coast, and I read that 120 million people were affected by today’s snowstorm. Yeah, 120 million people worked from home — on their March Madness brackets. "
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night was the big finale of “The Bachelor.” Nick wound up getting engaged to Vanessa, a teacher from Canada. Nick didn’t plan on marrying Vanessa, but after seeing the GOP healthcare plan, moving to Canada was the logical decision. "
Jimmy Fallon,"The ring Nick gave Vanessa when he proposed cost $100,000. Which explains the next show Vanessa will be appearing on, “Pawn Stars.” "
Jimmy Fallon,"But despite the engagement, it’s hard to say what Nick’s future holds, if you think about it. I mean, he’s a reality star who has married an immigrant he barely knows and — oh, my God, he’s going to be president of the United States. "
Jimmy Fallon,"I read about a marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles that doubles as an art gallery. Yep. Patrons stare at the art for hours before being told, “Sir, that’s an exit sign.” "
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s freezing all over the country except it was 86 degrees here in L.A. today. I won’t say it’s THE reason people hate us, but it’s one of the reasons everyone hates us."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Make no mistake: You turn on the Weather Channel, try to find out what’s going on, you see the meteorologists giving advice, telling you to be careful — make no mistake, those people are not on your side. Those people are rooting AGAINST us and FOR the weather, they’re rooting for the snow. "
Jimmy Kimmel,College students are out of town for spring break. This is the time of year students take a well-deserved break from partying and drinking at school to go party and drink on a beach or perhaps another town. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"Over the next few weeks more than 50,000 future careers will be ruined by photos posted on Facebook of spring break. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"If you are away on spring break, have fun, do whatever you need to do. Don’t forget Congress is about to take away your healthcare, so if you’re going to do something dumb, do it now while it’s still covered."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The NCAA basketball tournament is kind of under way. Tonight what they call the First Four starts, play-in games for the teams that have absolutely no chance of winning anything, they’re a waste of time. After tomorrow 64 teams will compete. The next few weeks they’ll be whittled down until only two teams remain. Then those two teams will get married by Chris Harrison, is that how it works?  "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Every year they do studies about all the money companies lose because their employees are watching the basketball tournament instead of working. That may have been true in 1995, but if your employees are wasting time watching basketball, they’d be wasting time on Instagram and Facebook. That’s just how it is. Wasting time is our full-time job now."
