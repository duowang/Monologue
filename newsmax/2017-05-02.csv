Jimmy Kimmel,Guest host Will Arnett
Jimmy Kimmel,My name is Will Arnett and I am your guest host here for the night. I’ll be filling in while your regular host is away. Just think of me as your depressed middle-aged substitute teacher who you definitely saw cry in his car before coming in. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"You may know me from my Netflix show “Flaked.” For those who don’t, it’s the thumbnail that you scroll past to get to “Narcos.”"

Jimmy Kimmel,"You know, it’s funny — Jimmy had a son and I dropped everything to come host this show. When I had my sons, all Jimmy did was send me an edible arrangement. Which, whatever, it’s not a competition — but if it WERE a competition, which it is, we can all clearly agree I’m the better friend, right? "
Jimmy Kimmel,"We’re lucky to even have a show tonight. Because there was a chance that the writers were going to go on strike. But fortunately a deal was made last night and they were able to go to work today. If a deal wasn’t reached, the writers were prepared to march outside all the major studios here, and they would have faced their greatest enemy: the sun."
Jimmy Kimmel,It’s great we were able to avoid a strike. If the strike had happened I’d be stuck coming here and coming up with my own words. Which would have been … you know … ungood. Ungooder. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump had a really big day, he spoke on the phone with Vladimir Putin today. They talked about Syria. And they talked about the Airbnb they’re going to share in Martha’s Vineyard together."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It was a pretty long call, although most of that was going, “No, you hang up. No, YOU hang up. No, nyet, you hang up.”"
