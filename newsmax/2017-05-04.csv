Seth Meyers,House Republicans today voted on and passed an Obamacare replacement bill without knowing how much it could cost. Though I’m not surprised — they also voted on an Obama replacement without knowing the cost. 
Seth Meyers,"
Congress narrowly passed Republican plan to replace Obamacare today. Also narrowly passing: Grandma. 
"
Seth Meyers,"A member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said yesterday that it can be difficult to negotiate with President Trump because it’s hard to tell what he’s thinking. Also, if."
Seth Meyers,"According to a new biography, former President Obama proposed to a serious girlfriend he had before he met Michelle Obama, but he paused so long she walked away. 

"
Seth Meyers,"Today was National Star Wars Day and if you celebrated, no girlfriend you have. "
James Corden,"Today was Star Wars Day, because the day was May Fourth, as in “May the fourth be with you.” And now, it’s technically May Fifth, Cinco de Mayo, as in “May the fifth margarita be in you.” "
James Corden,"Today isn’t only Cinco de Mayo, it’s also the one-year anniversary of this [Trump] tweet: “Happy #CincodeMayo. I love Hispanics!” You know, a year has gone by, but I’m just as embarrassed today as I was the day it was posted. "
James Corden,"I read that a restaurant just opened in Brooklyn that serves only avocados and avocado-based dishes. But even there, guac is still extra. "
James Corden,"When you and your friend are having the restaurant conversation, it never goes like this: “So what are you in the mood for? Italian? Mexican?” “Avocados. Only avocados.” "
James Corden,"Starbucks is up to their old tricks again. Starbucks in Japan is introducing a new drink called an American Cherry Pie Frappuccino. It’s a vanilla Frappuccino with chunks of cherry pie in it. I don’t know if this sounds like a healthy drink. Pretty sure it’s not, because this is what the barista writes on it when they serve it to you: “Bob, you have three weeks to live.” "
James Corden,"In other news, Dictionary.com has added 300 new words, including slang terms like b---hface, 4:20, and dad bod. “4:20” is being added to the dictionary. Because only a stoner would try to look up a number in the dictionary. "
James Corden,"“B---hface” and “dad bod” were added. If you don’t know what a b---hface is, it’s what I make when you say I have a dad bod. "
James Corden,Another word being added to dictionary.com is “man bun.” Hopefully the dictionary is the last place where we’ll ever see another man bun. 
Jimmy Fallon,"Today the House voted to pass the Republican healthcare bill before taking an 11-day recess. They say they’re going to use the break to kick back, relax, and finally read the bill they just voted for. "
Jimmy Fallon,Democrats are calling for the new Republican healthcare bill to be called “Trumpcare.” Experts say that’s the first time the words “Trump” and “care” have ever been said together. 
Jimmy Fallon,"
Reince Priebus said that Trump helped pass the bill by punting the ball into the end zone. When told that analogy didn’t quite make sense, he said, “I meant that he hit a grand slam into the net and slapped the puck right into the hoop. Is that better?” 

"
Jimmy Fallon,"Today, Trump tweeted that the media is out of control, saying that they will do or say anything to get attention. Then he honked the horn of an 18-wheeler, posed for a picture with Kid Rock, and accused Obama of spying on him from his microwave. "
Jimmy Fallon,President Trump canceled his White House Cinco de Mayo celebration. He made the decision after Mexico said they wouldn’t pay for it. 
Jimmy Kimmel,Guest hosted by Kristen Bell
Jimmy Kimmel,Hosting a late-night show is super exciting for me. I have two kids so I haven’t been up this late since 2012. 
Jimmy Kimmel,"
There’s very little chance I will know any of the guests tonight, unless one of them wrote “Goodnight, Moon,” or is Moana. Is Moana on the show? She’s not? Copy that.
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I’m putting all my training to use tonight. You know, I did go to NYU for acting but I dropped out because I got cast in a Broadway show. So, let that be a lesson to the kids out there. Stay in school — until something better and far more lucrative comes along. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"
I know this is probably different for all of you since you’re used to watching Jimmy at this time. Let’s be honest, you bought a ticket to “Rogue One” and now you’re watching Matt Damon’s China Wall ponytail movie. I get it, and I’m sorry.
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"But tonight, think of me as your babysitter. So, I guess, whatever — fend for yourselves while I make out with my boyfriend on your parents’ bed. 

"
Jimmy Kimmel,"For those of you who are observing, I’d like to wish you a happy Star Wars Day. Today is May the Fourth, as in “May the fourth be with you.” Can you imagine explaining Star Wars Day to someone who’s never seen the movie? “Yeah, it’s a holiday when we celebrate a movie about a brother and a sister who kiss.” "
