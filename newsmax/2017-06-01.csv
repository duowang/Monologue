Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump rang in the 1st of June with a major announcement. No one loves to announce an announcement more than Donald Trump. On Twitter last night, he wrote, ""I will be announcing my decision on Paris accord Thursday at 3:00 P.M., the White House Rose Garden, make America great again."" It made sense that he did it from the Rose Garden. While we still have roses and gardens. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"This deal that Trump backed out of, this is a deal that was signed by 194 other countries. The only two countries who are not part of the Paris accord, besides us, are Nicaragua and Syria. And they're doing great. I guess it's not a surprise, the fact that he pulled out. The president has been very big on pulling out ever since he had Donald Jr. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Meanwhile, I'm sure you know about covfefe at this point, right? So just after midnight yesterday the president wrote, ""Despite the constant negative press covfefe."" And that was it. And with that puzzling half-sentence, for a brief shining moment, Donald Trump made Twitter great again. "
Jimmy Kimmel,"Twitter went absolutely berserk. Not since Phil Collins gave us the word ""Susudio"" has a nation been so utterly fascinated and perplexed. You know a typo is bad when even Melania is like, 'I'm pretty sure that's not English, Donald.' Even after Trump deleted the tweet, which he almost never does, Sean Spicer claimed it was intentional. He said it wasn't a typo or a stroke. "
