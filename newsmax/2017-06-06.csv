James Corden,"We are here in the beautiful historic Central Hall Westminster. There is so much amazing history in this building. Gandhi spoke here, Martin Luther King, Jr. gave a speech here, and Winston Churchill spoke in this very hall. And despite all that, they still allowed me to do a show here. "
James Corden,"It's nice to be here in England. After two and a half years of presidential campaigning in America, I was, like, ""Where can I go for another bitter, soul-sucking election?"" "
James Corden,"Yes, there's a big election coming up this week in the U.K. Actually, this venue is going to be a polling station. Raise your hand if you didn't even know there was going to be a show here tonight, you were just trying to beat the lines. "
James Corden,"We talk about Donald Trump almost every night on this show, but I thought when I came here to London I'd finally get away from him for a little while. And then I get here, and who does he start a fight with? The mayor of London! While I'm in the city! He's following me! "
Jimmy Fallon,"A highly classified document was just leaked, and it suggests that Russia may have hacked into our voting systems before the election. You could tell the report was ""highly classified"" because it was marked, ""Don’t Show Trump."""
Jimmy Fallon,"It turns out Russia actually hacked the company that makes our voting machines. Which explains why anyone who pressed on ""Hillary Clinton"" heard a voice go, ""Try again."" "
Jimmy Fallon,"The NSA contractor who leaked the document is a woman named Reality Winner. When he was asked if he had any contact with the leaker, Trump said, ""Nope, I’m TOTALLY out of touch with Reality."""
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump’s been causing a lot of problems with the things he’s tweeted recently, but the White House says he isn’t concerned with being politically correct. Then they clarified their statement and said he isn't even concerned about being correct."
Jimmy Fallon,"The game show “Cash Cab” is coming back to the Discovery Channel! It’s a show where the driver asks passengers questions from the second they get into the car until they reach their destination — or as it’s called now, “Uber.”"
Seth Meyers,"The Department of Justice charged a federal contractor named Reality Leigh Winner yesterday with leaking classified materials to the press about Russia's meddling in the election.

"
Seth Meyers,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said that while schools receiving federal funds must abide by federal civil rights laws, the department will not enter decrees on things like LGBT discrimination. Coincidentally, LGBT is also how Betsy DeVos thinks you spell discrimination. "

Seth Meyers,"After the hackers gained access to the company's accounts, they then sent ""an email to trick local U.S. government employees into opening documents that were 'invisibly tainted with potent malware.'"" OK, they sent it to the poll workers. This is how democracy ends, with a fake email sent to the ancient cat lady manning the polling station at your high school gym. "
Seth Meyers,"So who really knows who won November 8? I mean, other than Vladimir Putin. I’m a little rusty on my Constitution, but I guess that means ... new election? Sure, let’s have another one! Let’s just get the band back together. Somebody find Jeb and wake him up."
Seth Meyers,"Now, all along, Donald Trump has said the entire Russia story is ""fake news."" And there is no way to know whether this document that was released was real ... other than the fact that the leaker was immediately arrested. ""Fake news, real prison."" "
