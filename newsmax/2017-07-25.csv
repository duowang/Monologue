Jimmy Fallon,"Today, Senate Republicans voted to move forward in the process to repeal and replace Obamacare, even though they don't know what they're going to be voting on. That’s like going into a hospital and telling the surgeon, ""Surprise me! Just go for it!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"That’s right, ahead of the healthcare vote, Senators were saying they had no clue what they’d be voting on. Then Americans said, ""Hey — just like us during the election!"""
Jimmy Fallon,"This morning, two senators were caught on a hot mic calling President Trump ""crazy."" And when the news came out, literally every member of the Senate was like, ""Wait, was it me?"""
Jimmy Fallon,"But people are still talking about this. Last night, President Trump gave a big speech at the Boy Scouts of America National Scout Jamboree. His healthcare bill won the award for “Scariest Campfire Story.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"And we’re still getting to know Trump’s new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci. I saw that his friends like to call him “the Mooch.” When Trump heard, he was like, “Great, now what am I gonna call Don Jr. and Eric?”"
