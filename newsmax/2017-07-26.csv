Jimmy Fallon,"Some big political news. Today President Trump went on Twitter and announced that he is banning transgender people from serving in the military. Trump said he understands this is a very sensitive issue, so he made sure to choose his emoji's very carefully."
Jimmy Fallon,"Actually, Trump says that he's banning transgender people from serving because of high medical costs. If he cares so much about high medical costs, maybe he should pass a healthcare bill."
Jimmy Fallon,"Trump was talking to reporters yesterday, after the big healthcare vote, and people noticed that he didn't seem to know how many senators there are. When told it is two for each state, Trump said, ""I'm going to need another clue."""
Jimmy Fallon,"Another big story is Trump's feud with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. When he was asked about what will happen to Sessions, Trump said, ""Time will tell."" When asked if he was just stealing lines off his magic eight ball, Trump said, ""Ask again later."""
