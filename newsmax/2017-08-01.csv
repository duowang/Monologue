Jimmy Kimmel,"We have the Olympics in 2028. Only 11 more years, and then volleyball! I feel like between climate change and Kim Jong Un it’s optimistic to think we’ll still have a Los Angeles in 2028."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The slogan for the Olympics is “Follow the Sun,” which is great advice if you want people walking directly into the ocean."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I’m excited about the Olympics being here, but I hope they really go for it. I’m going to start a movement to try to get them to let Snoop Dogg light the torch with a big red, white, and blue blunt. Have an L.A. Olympics!"
