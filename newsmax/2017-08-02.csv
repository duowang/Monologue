Jimmy Kimmel,"Did you hear what Trump said about living in the White House? According to Golf magazine, of all places, the president told a group of members at his club in New Jersey the White House is a real dump. A White House spokesperson today denied the president said that, so it's true."
Jimmy Kimmel,"To be fair, Donald Trump thinks any building that doesn't have his name on it is a dump."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The president is in an absolute tailspin. His approval rating is in the basement. And, he's living in a dump."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tomorrow the president is leaving for a two-week vacation to his beloved Bedminster golf club in New Jersey. Finally, he'll get time to play some golf."
