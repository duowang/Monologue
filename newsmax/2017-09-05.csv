Jimmy Kimmel,"Labor Day, in case you don't know history, was established all the way back in 1894 as a way to give Americans an extra day to dread going back to work after the weekend. And it's been very successful. We were off for two weeks. And it's interesting. When we left, we were busy reliving the Civil War. Now we're back with the good old-fashioned Korean War."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Pumpkin spice latte season is happening now, which is great news. My doctor's been saying I haven't been getting enough syrup in my diet."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Meanwhile, our pumpkin spice president was very busy. He was on the scene in Houston over the weekend to meet with Texans affected by Hurricane Harvey. And watch this. He's with a group. They were serving meals to people who were displaced from their homes. They handed him a pair of latex gloves for health reasons because he's serving food. And here's how that went: ""My hands are too big."" His hands are too big for the gloves. Like O.J. They're too big."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This morning our president woke up and asked his staff, ""Now that this hurricane is over, what's something horrible I can do to distract people from the Russia investigation?"" Someone said, ""You know, there are 800,000 innocent kids you could deport for no good reason."" And he said, ""Done and done."""
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump has decided to do away with what's known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — DACA, they call it. It's a program that gives undocumented immigrants whose parents brought them into the country when they were children the chance to work and go to school legally. And this is what he wants to do away with. Mostly because President Obama's the one who ordered it. It seems like his main agenda is just to undo everything Obama did. I hope he doesn't bring bin Laden back to life."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The president's spokesperson said it was a difficult decision, the president's been debating it for months, but ultimately Donald Trump believes that if these kids want to be American they have to do it the right way. By marrying Donald Trump. And that's as simple as that."
