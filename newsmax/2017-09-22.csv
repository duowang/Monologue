Jimmy Fallon,"Last night Kim Jong Un released a rare statement attacking President Trump and referred to him as a dotard. Then Trump said, “Sticks and stones may break my bones but words I don’t know will never hurt me.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"John McCain says he will not support the Republican healthcare bill, even though it was written by his best friend in the Senate, Lindsey Graham. You can tell Graham feels betrayed, because tonight, he released his own cover of “Look What You Made Me Do.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"This week, a truck carrying 40,000 pounds of vodka overturned in North Carolina. The driver is fine. He said he’s shaken, but not stirred."
