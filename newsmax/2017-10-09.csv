Jimmy Kimmel,"My wife and I went to a wedding in central California on the weekend. On the way home, our electric car ran out of, er, electric. I went and got a flu shot at Walmart while it was charging for three hours. And I got in a fight with the president’s son on Twitter. So just a normal, regular — you know, the usual weekend."
Jimmy Kimmel,"On Saturday morning, my wife woke me up with the phone in her hand because President Trump tweeted the following, “Late night hosts are dealing with the Democrats for their very unfunny and repetitive material. Always anti-Trump. Should we get equal time?” Which is an interesting question. Especially as the president tweeted this demand for equal time after watching Fox & Friends breathlessly drool about how great he is for three hours straight. As far as being repetitive goes, I agree with Donald Trump. I hate it when people are repetitive [shows clips of Trump repeating words and phrases]."
Jimmy Kimmel,"We got that out of the way. Put the tweet up again. Because he took the time with those little thumbs to put the word “unfunny” in quotes, which means we have a president who doesn’t know how air quotes work. We basically have Joey from “Friends” running this country. I responded to President Joey. Then Little Joey — Donald J. Trump Jr., DJTJ— replied to me after I replied to his father."
Jimmy Kimmel,"People are pointing to the fact that Harvey Weinstein was a Clinton supporter — I'm not defending Hillary Clinton. Fact is, her campaign did take money from what turned out to be a high-profile man who has been accused of sexual harassment multiple times. Not just one. She took money from Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump, who donated to Hillary's campaign. Note to DJTJ Next time you are defending your father, you think it’s good to draw a comparison between him and a sexual predator? Don’t. Doesn’t help."
Jimmy Kimmel,"But anyway — I did make a promise. I did promise a Harvey Weinstein joke. Here it goes. What's the difference between Harvey Weinstein and the Pillsbury dough boy? When the Pillsbury dough boy offers you a roll, he doesn’t ask you to take a shower for it. There you go."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This is the number one Trump feud of the day, if not the year so far. Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana, not to be confused with Ivanka, has a new book coming out tomorrow called “Raising Trump,” in which she talks about what a great job she did raising those kids. And there’s interesting nuggets in the book. She claims when pregnant with her first child, Trump told her he didn’t want to name him Donald Jr. because, and I quote, “What if he’s a loser?” And now every time they talk, he’s like, I told you we shouldn't — anyway."
