Jimmy Kimmel,"Last week we learned that Rex Tillerson was quoted as calling Trump an ""effing moron"" behind his back. Trump tweeted the story was false. Clearly this is still eating at the president. This morning in a new interview with Forbes Magazine, they asked him about it and he said, ""I think it's fake news. If he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests and I can tell you who was going to win."" Rex Tillerson, right?"
Jimmy Kimmel,No intelligent person would get into an IQ contest with his own secretary of state. At this point I'm not sure Donald Trump could finish the maze on the back of a Denny's kids' menu.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I would definitely pay $100 to watch Rex Tillerson and Donald Trump take IQ tests against each other. And I guarantee the next day, Kellyanne Conway would be saying that the lower the number, the better the score."
