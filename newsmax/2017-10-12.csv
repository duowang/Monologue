Jimmy Kimmel,"Early this morning at 1:42 a.m., an asteroid passed by the Earth, missed us by 26,000 miles. Which in space terms is close. In fact, the asteroid was planning to hit us, then it saw what’s going on down here and said, “You know what? I’m going to keep going that way, I want no part of that.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump this morning got to work doing the damage the asteroid couldn’t. Today he signed an executive order that threatens to cripple the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. He tweeted, “Since Congress can’t get its act together on healthcare, I’ll be using the power of the pen to give great healthcare to many people fast.” This is big — usually when Trump uses the power of the pen, it’s to declare bankruptcy."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Meanwhile the president’s inexplicable battle with Puerto Rico rages on. Trump fired off a trio of early-morning tweets saying Puerto Rico’s infrastructure was a disaster before Hurricane Maria, blaming them for their own financial problems, and warning that the government won’t be there to help them indefinitely. And also, those paper towels? He wants those back."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump’s chief of staff, Gen. John Kelly, had a rare press conference — I think it may have been his first press conference as chief of staff — to announce reports of his demise have been bigly exaggerated [clip of Kelly]: “I’m not getting fired.” So you know what that means, right? He’s fired!"
