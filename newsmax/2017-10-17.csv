Jimmy Kimmel,"It seems like every time we come to Brooklyn something weird happens, and sure enough this afternoon, something weird happened. Breaking news out of Brooklyn, a cow was on the loose. In L.A. we go through a similar thing every time Gary Busey gets out of his pen."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This cow was actually a baby bull, it escaped from a slaughterhouse. The only slaughter house in Brooklyn that hasn't been converted into an art gallery/event space. It ended up on a soccer field, which any parent can tell you that's the worst place to be."
Jimmy Kimmel,It took two hours to get ahold of this baby bull. The police were finally able to wrangle it and I believe it was charged with endangerment. This is the first cow chase if two years. I think you might be going a little overboard the farm to table thing.
Jimmy Kimmel,The bull is being sent to a rehabilitation facility for misbehaving cows. That's the good news. The bad news is it is also where they sent Harvey Weinstein.
