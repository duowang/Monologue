Jimmy Kimmel,We are broadcasting all this week from the Howard Gillman opera house from the Brooklyn academy of music. I love Brooklyn but I want to be honest the real reason we're here is to get as far out of North Korea's missile range as possible.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tonight in the Bronx, the Yankees right now are playing the Astros in game five of the American league championship series. Apparently the Astros are now in the American league, which still doesn't feel right to me."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Let me just say something as a Mets fan. The Yankees may have more World Series rings than anyone but they'll never have what the Mets have, a mascot with a giant baseball for a head. That belongs to us."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Not only was tonight game five of the ALCS, the first game of the new NBA season for the Brooklyn Nets. The Knicks and the Nets, according to Las Vegas, have the worst odds of winning the title this season of any teams in the NBA. The odds are 1,000-1. Which means if you were to bet $100 on the Knicks or Nets you would lose $100."
