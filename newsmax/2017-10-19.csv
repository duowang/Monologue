Jimmy Kimmel,"Last night I wanted to feel like I live here so I did maybe the most New York thing a person can do. I put on a big, puffy jacket, went down to the subway, and forced people to buy my mix tape."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Went to see Bruce Springsteen last night on Broadway. And you're not going to believe this, he was great. Turns out he's really great. Bruce almost restored my faith in America last night. And then the president tweeted and it was gone again."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Have you seen these? This is a real thing, the dog parker, a place to park your dog. It was invented by a woman here in Brooklyn who describes herself as a dog mom. She said she wanted to go more places with her dog but wasn't comfortable going into a shop to get coffee without locking her best friend in a miniature prison."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The door is controlled by an app, you pay and the app opens the door, put your pet in and it locks, which is perfect if you want to steal a doghouse with a dog already in it."
Jimmy Kimmel,A quick way to know you shouldn't have a dog is if you think locking it in an easy bake oven while you get coffee is a good idea.
