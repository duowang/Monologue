Jimmy Kimmel,"Starting, as we often do, with President Trump, who has been in Asia for four days: Still no mushroom cloud, so that's a positive."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump is in South Korea right now. And part of the fun of Donald Trump being in a foreign country is figuring out what he is going to eat in that country. This is what was on the menu tonight: grilled sole fish, shrimp stir fry with noodles and Korean beef served with a 360-year-old soy sauce. If there is anyone who could appreciate a 360-year-old soy sauce, it is a guy who likes Chicken McNuggets."
Jimmy Kimmel,"But he is not there to eat. He is there to neutralize the threat. He said, “Ultimately, it will all work out. It always works out.” Yeah, right. In the movies. Let's face it. Bruce Willis is not going to show up to save us. Best case, Dennis Rodman shows up to save us."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump tomorrow makes a speech in South Korea and then travels to China, which will be fun. He'll get to see where all his Trump-brand ties are made."
