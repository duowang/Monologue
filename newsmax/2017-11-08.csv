Jimmy Kimmel,"Today, Twitter doubled the amount of characters you can use from 140 to 280 characters. I think this means Twitter is now Facebook, right? They're basically the same thing — or is it possible there is anyone on the planet who thought, ""You know what this year needs? More Twitter."""
Jimmy Kimmel,President Trump is either going to have to quit Twitter or someone is going to have to teach him more words.
Jimmy Kimmel,"I know it sounds crazy but I think I'm going to miss the way Trump would post a tweet that ended with “dot, dot, dot…” and we'd have to wait 23 minutes to see what the rest of his angry sentence was going to be. Now all that drama is gone."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Twitter decided to double the character limit on the same day Trump arrived in China, one of the only places on Earth where it is illegal to use Twitter. His little thumbs must be going wild."
