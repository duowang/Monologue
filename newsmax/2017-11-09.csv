Jimmy Kimmel,It was a beautiful day here in southern California. Very pleasant. You noticed the last couple of days have been very pleasant? Do you think it has anything to do with the fact that Trump is out of the country?
Jimmy Kimmel,The president of the United States was in China today. Either that or they sent him to the Epcot Center and pulled it off.
Jimmy Kimmel,"He’s been around with Chinese President XI Jinping. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He loves Chinese food. He’s been having all his favorites. The No. 3, the No. 7, the No. 12 with mustard sauce."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump has had harsh words for China in the past. He called them America’s enemy, he said they were responsible for the greatest theft in the history of the world, he said they created the climate change hoax, he accused the Chinese of raping the United States. They had a parade for him — all is forgiven, now everything is good."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It’s possible if we send him to Mexico, he’d tell them he isn’t trying to build a wall, he’s trying to build a racquetball court or something. His tune changes dramatically."
