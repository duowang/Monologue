Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump, on his first day back in the United States after a 12-day trip through Asia, started the morning with a flurry of tweets. Trump took to Twitter today to brag about the stock market, attack The New York Times, promote ""Fox and Friends,"" promote Sean Hannity, criticize three UCLA basketball players, send his condolences after another multi-victim shooting to the wrong city in the wrong state. And that's it, I think. It's like he never left."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He also lashed out at CNN. He wrote, ""While in the Philippines I was forced to watch CNN, which I've not done in months, and again realized how bad and fake it is. Loser!"" Who is he calling loser? He knows CNN is not a guy, right?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I get the sense he walks around the White House yelling at inanimate objects. ""The lamp didn't turn on. Loser!"""
Jimmy Kimmel,"The president hasn't weighed in on the biggest story of the week, Roy Moore. Donald Trump's in a real bind. On one hand, he doesn't want to support an accused pedophile for Senate. His other hand is grabbing a woman by the — you know what I'm saying."
Jimmy Kimmel,Roy Moore is running for U.S. Senate in Alabama and there are many reasons he should not be a U.S. senator. The latest and most shocking are accusations of child molestation. He's been accused by five women of sexual misconduct and/or assault when they were young teenagers. They put him on a watch list at the mall. What man in his 30s is even willingly going to the mall in the first place?
