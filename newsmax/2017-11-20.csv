Jimmy Fallon,"It came out that national security adviser H.R. McMaster called President Trump an idiot, and said he had the intelligence of a kindergartner. And Trump said, “Oh, yeah? Then why am I reading at a first grade level? And tweeting at a sixth grade level!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"This weekend Trump sent a tweet where he criticized Senator Jeff Flake for saying bad things about, quote, “your favorite president.” People were like, “He said bad things about Obama?”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Al Franken said that he isn’t resigning, but will spend the next few days reflecting. Reflecting is a political term meaning “hope someone else gets busted and this whole thing blows over.”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night Charles Manson died at the age of 83. Which means today he met his new roommates, Adolf, Osama, and the Time Warner customer service reps."
