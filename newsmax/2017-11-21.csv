Jimmy Fallon,"Today the White House held its annual turkey pardon and President Trump pardoned a turkey named Drumstick. Which was nice until he told the turkey, ""Okay, now you pardon me."""
Jimmy Fallon,"But there were actually two turkeys and before the ceremony the White House tweeted out a poll asking people which turkey should be pardoned. Leave it to Trump to turn a fun annual tradition into ""Sophie's Choice."""
Jimmy Fallon,"Before the ceremony, the White House actually tweeted out profiles for each bird. Kind of cute. This is real. Here's a profile for Drumstick. It says stuff like, date of birth, height, and wingspan. Well this is kind of weird, after they met Trump, the turkeys actually released a profile of him. Take a look, first it says, date of birth, June 14th, 1946. For height it says 6'2,"" and for height of tie it says, 6'4."" For wingspan it says six feet. And for hand span it says, three inches. For mating call, it says, ""Come on, Melania, I know you're not really asleep."" Finally, for bird call, it says, ""Tweet, tweet, tweet."""
Jimmy Fallon,"CBS just fired Charlie Rose after allegations of sexual harassment. Yep. They told him to clear out his desk, put on some pants and leave."
