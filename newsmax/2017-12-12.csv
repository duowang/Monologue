Jimmy Fallon,"Today was the big Alabama Senate election. And, as promised, Roy Moore rode his horse to the polls. But it got weird when people said, “Can we vote for the horse?”"
Jimmy Fallon,The horse Roy Moore rode was named Sassy. And what doesn’t say “I’m innocent” like a 70-year-old man riding a horse named Sassy?
Jimmy Fallon,"Last night Roy Moore's wife tried to defend him against bigotry claims by saying, quote, ""One of our attorneys is a Jew."" Soooo, happy first night of Hanukkah, everyone!"
Jimmy Fallon,"President Trump was all over Twitter today. And I read that Vladimir Putin gets daily reports of Trump’s tweets. And every day, Putin reads them and says, “My God, what have I done?”"
Jimmy Fallon,"Speaking of tweets, Trump got in a Twitter fight with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand over his sexual assault allegations. Just this week he insulted a senator, endorsed Roy Moore, and called 20 women liars. It’s like he saw his approval rating was 32 and said, “I bet I can get it under 30 by the weekend.”"
