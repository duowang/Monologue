Jimmy Kimmel,"Last night there was real concern the voters in Alabama would put an alleged child molester and bigot and homophobe, all the bad things Santa frowns on, in the United States Senate. But it didn't happen. The special election actually turned out to be a very special election after all."
Jimmy Kimmel,A Republican losing to a Democrat in Alabama is like a grizzly bear losing to a fish.
Jimmy Kimmel,"If the Republican you're running against is not allowed inside Forever 21, your odds of winning increase significantly."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It is kind of depressing that in 2017, barely not electing an alleged pedophile to the Senate is something to celebrate."
Jimmy Kimmel,"At the Roy Moore post-election party they were NOT celebrating. They were also not giving up. Roy Moore refused to concede. On top of that, his horse got towed. It was very sad."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Not only didn't he concede, as of tonight he still hasn't conceded. He said God will decide when it's over. Guess what. God decided. It's over. God went home."
Jimmy Kimmel,God's sitting on his couch watching Netflix right now. It's done.
