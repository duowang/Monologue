Jimmy Kimmel,The new Star Wars movie has finally arrived. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” opened in theaters tonight. I feel we need more time between the Star Wars movies. As soon as you come out of the theater you have to get in line for the next one. It’s expected to be the No. 1 movie with a colon in the title at the box office this weekend.
Jimmy Kimmel,"The big news in show business is that Disney is buying Fox — or most of Fox. Disney, the company that owns our network, ABC, is buying 21st Century Fox for more than $60 billion. Bad news, now we only have about $300 left to make the next Star Wars movie."
