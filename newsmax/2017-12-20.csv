Jimmy Fallon,"President Trump had a very good day. He’s very proud – Republicans finally passed his tax bill which means Trump’s about to sign his first major piece of legislation. Yep, his chest was puffed out so far his tie was actually at a normal length. “Wow! It’s actually at my waist!”"
Jimmy Fallon,"But Trump was very happy. He said “we are now pouring rocket fuel into the engine of our economy.” And if you've ever poured rocket fuel into a regular engine, you know it ruins the engine."
Jimmy Fallon,"There’s been a lot of criticism. I read that only 24 percent of Americans think the GOP tax plan is “good.” To put that in perspective, The Spice Girls movie got a 29 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes."
Jimmy Fallon,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that the tax plan is ""an all-out looting of America, a wholesale robbery of the middle class."" Which incidentally, is also the slogan for Whole Foods."
Jimmy Fallon,"The University of Pennsylvania, which is Trump’s alma mater, says the tax bill will add 2.2 trillion dollars to the national debt. Trump was like, ""Come on - are you really gonna believe a school that let ME graduate? Gimme a break!”"
