Jimmy Kimmel,"The stars gathered in Los Angeles for the Golden Globes. Oprah Winfrey delivered a speech so powerful that all day long people have been asking if Oprah will run for president — which at this point, wouldn’t president be a demotion for Oprah?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Now that we have Donald Trump, everything seems possible."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Reporters asked the White House today for their response to a potential Oprah candidacy. Team Trump said, we welcome the challenge whether it be Oprah Winfrey or anybody else. Preferably not anybody else."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I mean, with Trump’s approval rating right now, I don’t think he could beat Maury Povich for president, never mind Oprah!"
Jimmy Kimmel,"But the president was supposed to host his own awards show tonight, the fake news awards that he announced would be presented tonight at 5 o’clock. They’ve been postponed until next Wednesday, which is — you know, postponing his own awards show is an odd and out of character move for a man who consistently delivers his promises in a very timely fashion."
Jimmy Kimmel,"I guess it’s because he had to be in Atlanta tonight for the college football national championship game. The Georgia Bulldogs are playing the Alabama Crimson Tide. Trump was rooting for Alabama, for the Crimson Tide, because that’s what he calls his face."
