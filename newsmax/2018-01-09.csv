Jimmy Kimmel,"Anybody watch the college football championship game last night? What a game. It was such a good game, I did the unthinkable. I turned off ""The Bachelor"" to watch it."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The Alabama Crimson Tide rallied from, I think, 13 points to beat Georgia in overtime to win their fifth national title in nine years. [shows clip of winning touchdown] The kid who threw that pass is the backup quarterback. His name is Tua Tagovailoa, I believe. What a game he had. The state of Alabama hasn't seen a freshman scramble like that since Roy Moore visited a local high school."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Tickets for the game last night were at a minimum of $2,000. But, as part of that price you got to see President Trump try to sing our national anthem. It appears he might not know all the words to his anthem he talks about so much. [shows clip of Trump appearing to fumble lyrics] Yeah, no way he wins “Lip-Sync Battle” with a performance like that."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The only part of the song he remembers is ""red glare,"" because that's also the shade of the fake tanner he uses."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He did not seem to know all the words to the anthem. But there might be a good explanation for it. You know how the president keeps telling us he's a genius? Well, it turns out he isn't. I know, I was surprised, too."
Jimmy Kimmel,"There's a website called Fact Base that did an analysis of the first 30,000 words spoken in office by every U.S. president since Herbert Hoover. So they loaded all the speeches into a computer, and what their software found is that President Trump speaks at a fourth-grade level, lower than any president they've ever measured."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Herbert Hoover is at the top, 11th grade level. Obama was in third place with ninth grade. And then, way all the way in the back of the class in the fourth grade, there's Donald Trump. Remember that show ""Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader""? He's not."
