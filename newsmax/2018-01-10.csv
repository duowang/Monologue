Jimmy Kimmel,"There are a lot of things to dislike about L.A.: traffic, pollution, people. But it's important sometimes to stop and appreciate the fact that A) We don't have to scrape ice off our windshield every morning, and B) I can wear the same pair of teal-colored dolphin shorts to work every day since 1985. I appreciate it, and I like to think my coworkers appreciate it, I really do."
Jimmy Kimmel,"At the White House, the chief of staff, John Kelly, is reportedly asking people who work at the White House whether or not they're planning to stay on the job through the end of the year. Morale among staffers is reported to be low. Why? I have no idea. Seems like everything's going great."
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump had his first Cabinet meeting of the year today, where — and you're not going to believe this — he took time out to boast about the media's reaction to his bipartisan meeting yesterday with members of Congress. (clip of Trump) ""Got great reviews by everybody other than two networks who were phenomenal for about two hours. Then after that, they were called by their bosses, 'Oh, wait a minute.' And unfortunately, a lot of those anchors sent us letters saying that was one of the greatest meetings they've ever witnessed."" Really? A lot of those anchors sent you letters saying it was one of the greatest meetings ever? I bet the handwriting on those letters looks a lot like Kellyanne Conway's."
