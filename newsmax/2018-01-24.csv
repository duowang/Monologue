Jimmy Kimmel,"Thank you for joining us on what has been an uncharacteristically calm evening here in the United States. It's funny. We were in the office today, just kind of hanging out, waiting for something to happen like it does every day. And nothing really happened, which was strange. And then I realized oh, yeah, the reason it's quiet is because Donald Trump is on a plane right now. He's out of the country."
Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump is on his way to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. He'll only be there for a night, but that should be plenty of time for him to say something racist."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He's there to meet with other world leaders, to give a speech, and he’s there judging the Swiss Miss Universe pageant. It’s really the best pageant, because the women come with mini marshmallows and they're delicious."
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump plans to tell the world that America is open for business. And who better to make that declaration than a man who declared bankruptcy six different times.
Jimmy Kimmel,"According to a new poll, the majority of Americans don't trust President Trump with the nuclear button. Fifty-two percent of the public say they're worried the president might launch a nuclear attack for no good reason. I just wonder who are the 48 percent not worried? I wouldn't trust Donald Trump with a belly button."
