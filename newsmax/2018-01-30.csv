Conan O'Brian,"President Trump gave his State of the Union address, and as per tradition, someone who opposes the president gave the rebuttal. So, this year's rebuttal was given by Melania."
Conan O'Brian,"President Trump's approval rating is above 50 percent in just a handful of states. Those states include Georgia, Mississippi, and Denial."
Conan O'Brian,"Trump said he now supports a plan for young immigrants to become citizens. When asked why, Trump said, ""Because I may have to look for a new wife soon."""
Conan O'Brian,"In other White House news, a recent article revealed that Melania Trump was blindsided by the story about her husband having an affair with a porn star and that she is ""furious."" In fact, she was so upset, Melania chose to stay home instead of accompanying her husband to the World Economic Forum last week. Which had to be tough, because I think we all know how much Melania loves world economic forums."
Conan O'Brian,I don't know if I believe this article. They said Melania was furious. How can you tell? She always looks furious.
