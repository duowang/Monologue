Jimmy Kimmel,"Today is an important day in American history. Today is Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. Abraham Lincoln was born 209 years ago. Of course, he was tragically assassinated at Ford’s Theater in Washington by a member of MS-13 … I read that on the White House website. Is that not right?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Lincoln was known as honest, the great emancipator, the rail splitter, tight coop … he had a lot of nicknames … he was like the Diddy of 1863. Even had his own vodka."
Jimmy Kimmel,"On Friday night there was a cyber-attack in Pyeongchang. Someone attacked the official Olympic website and took out Wi-Fi in the stadium during the opening ceremonies, which was devastating. Thousands of people had to wait until they got back to their hotels to post to Instagram."
Jimmy Kimmel,But the real story of the Olympics surprisingly aren't athletes. The stars of the Olympics so far are the cheerleaders from North Korea. Have you seen these North Korean cheerleaders? Kim Jong Un sent a team of more than 200 women to cheer on the North Korean athletes and it doesn't seem like they know what they're cheering. The North Korean women lost to Switzerland in hockey 8-0. They cheered the Zamboni machine when it came out.
Jimmy Kimmel,Really. These women are cheering like their lives depend on it. Because they do. They literally do.
