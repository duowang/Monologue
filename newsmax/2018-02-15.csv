Jimmy Kimmel,"Another escapee from President Trump penitentiary is making the rounds, Reince Priebus . You might remember Reince Priebus as the man nobody remembers, the former White House Chief of Staff."
Jimmy Kimmel,"He's quoted in a forthcoming about White House chiefs of staff. He said for all the stories about how chaotic everything is, take everything you've heard and multiply it by 50. My god, how many porn stars did this president sleep with?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"If you multiply by it by 50, that means we are 5,000% screwed."
Jimmy Kimmel,Priebus said he was slightly embarrassed about his short tenure at the White House. Slightly? What would have to happen for him to be really embarrassed?
Jimmy Kimmel,Vice President Pence is shedding light on what he did and did not do when he was seated by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un's sister during the opening ceremony.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Pence explained he didn't avoid her, he ignored her. Like he does all women."
Jimmy Kimmel,We have a picture of the Vice president and his wife with Kim Yo Jong between them. You could cut the sexual tension with an intermediate-range ballistic missile here.
Jimmy Kimmel,"But North Koreans haven't been allowed to see much of the sport because -- possibly because they haven't been doing well, they have no medals. The footage they do get to see is heavily edited."
