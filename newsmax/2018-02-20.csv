Jimmy Kimmel,Trump basically went on a rampage this weekend. Ran his Twitter mobile off a cliff. He had a multiday rager during which he insulted everyone from a senator to Obama to the FBI to Oprah.
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump also tweeted Russia is laughing their asses off at us. Which is true. They have been laughing their asses off since November 2016. They have been laughing so hard they have no asses left.
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump awarded medal of valor to a North Carolina Deputy Sheriff who pulled a man out of a burning car. Now, this is a lay-up. I mean, nothing controversial here. All the president has to do is put that medal around this gentleman's neck."
Jimmy Kimmel,"No problem, right? I mean, what could be easier than, oh. I believe that's called a metaphor. Clearly he has never helped Melania with a necklace before. And yet that was still his most successful act as president this month."
