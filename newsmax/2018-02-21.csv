James Corden,"This morning, Donald Trump went on Twitter to call out his own attorney general Jeff Sessions tweeting. ""Question: If all the Russian meddling took place during the Obama administration, why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't DEM crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff session!"" There's a few things wrong with this tweet. For starters, why is Trump telling us to ask Jeff Sessions all of these questions? Trump is his boss!"
James Corden,"Mr. President, you know that thing you use to send the tweets? You can also use it to call Jeff Sessions and ask him yourself."
James Corden,This is where it really gets stupid. He didn’t even spell Jeff Sessions name right.
James Corden,"In other Trump news, according to a New York Times survey of political scientists across both parties, Donald Trump has been rated America’s worst president ever. I had a sneaking suspicion. It’s pretty incredible because it’s the first time Trump has won a popular vote."
James Corden,"In technology news, the organization that oversees emoji’s has changed the lobster emoji after people in Maine complained that it didn't have the correct number of legs!"
James Corden,"Now every time I text someone about lobsters I don't have to type the word ""Lobster emoji plus two extra legs."" It's a lifesaver."
James Corden,"When they heard about this, lobsters were like ""Thanks for fixing the emoji but while you're at it, can you stop boiling us?"""
