Jimmy Kimmel,"Everybody is into March Madness. Everybody bets — President Obama filled out a bracket. He picked Michigan State to win. President Trump, however, did not. He likes to wait to fill out his bracket until after the tournament so he can tell us that he got them all right."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Yet another day of March Madness for the president: According to the “failing” New York Times, special prosecutor Robert Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump Organization, the president’s company, demanding that they hand over any documents related to business they may have done in Russia. In an investigation like this, it is important to follow the money no matter how many porn stars it leads to."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Donald Trump, surprisingly, hasn’t tweeted about the subpoena yet. Probably because he doesn’t know how to spell the word subpoena."
Jimmy Kimmel,"There are rumors he may try to fire Robert Mueller, the guy who is investigating him, which — that would have to be it, right? At that point, we have to wait until he goes to Mar-a-Lago and lock him in it forever."
Jimmy Kimmel,Trump said Mueller looking into his finances is a red line he wouldn’t allow to be crossed and now it is presumably being crossed. Why do I think this ends with Melania in a trench coat handing files over in an underground parking lot?
Jimmy Kimmel,"There are new developments in the case of Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who may or definitely did have sex with Donald Trump. She is trying to raise money to pay her legal fees. She launched a fundraising page on a website called CrowdJustice.com. So now you can give money to a porn star just like the president of the United States."
Jimmy Kimmel,"In 24 hours, she’s raised more than $135,000. I never would have thought giving money to a porn star would be an act of patriotism. But then, I never thought a guy who would get in a Twitter war with Cher would become president."
Jimmy Kimmel,Every dollar you donate potentially brings us one step closer to seeing photos that will haunt our dreams forever.
Jimmy Kimmel,Toys R Us is going out of business. They’re closing all 735 of their stores and they’re putting Babies R Us up for adoption.
Jimmy Kimmel,I’ll always remember Toys R Us as the store where my children had a complete and total meltdown each and every time we went there. I guess people don’t enjoy that anymore. They buy toys on Amazon. Amazon will not rest until every other store is an abandoned warehouse teeming with raccoons.
