Jimmy Kimmel,"The president started Easter with a tweet. He wrote “HAPPY EASTER!” in all caps. Happy Easter, dammit!"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Today, on the day after Easter, the White House had the 140th annual Easter Egg Roll. This has been going on since 1878 when Rutherford B. Hayes was president. This year it was different, though — Trump heard “egg roll” and promised to make the Chinese pay for it."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It was a fun day for the president. He blew the whistle, he got to eat chocolate, he even met a nice kid named Barron who he really liked."
Jimmy Kimmel,"This event is officially hosted by the first lady every year. Melania Trump joined the president on the balcony to get things going. Trump said, “I want to really thank the first lady, Melania. She worked so hard on this event.” Not a chance she did one thing to set that up. She didn't dye eggs, she didn’t fill baskets — the only thing she's been working on is an escape tunnel."
Jimmy Kimmel,"The president officially declared the month of April to be National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. At this point he's just messing with us, right? He might as well declare it National Bankrupt Casino Awareness Month."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Vladimir Putin could soon be coming to America. During their phone call last month — the one where Trump wasn't supposed to congratulate Putin — not only did Trump congratulate him, he invited his KG-BFF to a summit at the White House. It’s about time he invited the boss over for dinner."
Jimmy Kimmel,"So, this will be a nice opportunity for Putin to stop by and install a few new Nest cameras in the White House."
