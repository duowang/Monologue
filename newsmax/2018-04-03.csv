Jimmy Kimmel,"We had a little bit of a weird day here at our office today because we had no college basketball games. All of the TVs were off. Nobody knew what to do. Someone said maybe we should work, and then everyone laughed and started checking Instagram again."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Last night Villanova beat Michigan to win the men’s college basketball tournament. We had about 75 people in our office pool and one of our producers, Gina, won it. She beat everybody. So I asked her today, ""On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you follow college basketball?"" She said, ""Zero."" That's how it goes. You know nothing and you win. Like being president in a way."
Jimmy Kimmel,"But congratulations to Villanova. March Madness is now over, and just like that, we have nothing to talk to our coworkers about until “Game of Thrones” comes back."
Jimmy Kimmel,"We are all in very good hands if there's an earthquake tonight because Dwayne Johnson is here. The Rock is promoting a new movie called ""Rampage,"" which is based on either the classic video game or what happens when the president runs out of McNuggets."
