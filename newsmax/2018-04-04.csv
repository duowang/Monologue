Jimmy Kimmel,"I thought it might be nice to start the show on a positive note with a special message from a special man, the host of “The 700 Club,” Mr. Pat Robertson, with a thought for the day: “There’s nothing in the Bible about mermaids. I think they're kind of half-fish and half-women. I don't think that such a creature exists.” Well, thanks, Pat. I'm glad you finally cleared the mermaid controversy up."
Jimmy Kimmel,"A kid wrote in and asked Pat if the Bible said it was OK to play with mermaid toys. Good news, it is. Imagine if you go to Hell and it's for that."
Jimmy Kimmel,"There's new information about Donald Trump and the Russia investigation. According to The Washington Post, last month special counsel Robert Mueller told the president's lawyers he was a subject of the investigation but not the target of the investigation. Which is kind of like when the principal at your school says, “I got my eye on you, mister.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,"But Mueller told Trump that, while he is not a criminal target, he still needs to ask him some questions. Basically he's treating the president like the guy who used to work with the woman who turned up dead on this week's ""Law & Order."""
Jimmy Kimmel,"Some people think he could be saying this to bait Trump into sitting down at an interview. If you want to bait Trump, you leave a trail of cheeseburgers. That's how you bait him."
