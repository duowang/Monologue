Jimmy Kimmel,"It is first lady Melania Trump’s birthday today. The president celebrated this morning with a bonkers 30-minute-long phone call to ""Fox & Friends,"" at the start of which they asked, what'd you get Melania for her birthday? He said he's too busy to buy her a present — keeping in mind he said this during a 30-minute-long rambling call to “Fox & Friends.”"
Jimmy Kimmel,He told them he got her a beautiful card. A beautiful green card.
Jimmy Kimmel,"And then during the interview, Trump accidentally admitted that Michael Cohen did represent him in the Stormy Daniels “please be quiet now” case. So, happy birthday, honey!"
Jimmy Kimmel,"I mean, if ever there was a year to get your wife a nice gift, this would be it. This would be the year. If you could spend $130,000 on a porn star, you could at least spring for a necklace. Right?"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Bill Cosby, one of the most beloved and successful TV stars of all-time, was convicted on three counts of indecent assault today. He could very well spend the rest of his life eating pudding in prison."
Jimmy Kimmel,"So they asked Trump, since he isn't getting enough credit, they asked him to assess his own performance to date. What grade do you think the president gave himself? Let's find out. [Trump clip] “I would give myself an A-plus.” That's right, A-plus. Not an A, an A-plus. Just an unbiased review from a guy who names everything from neck ties to meat after himself, an A-plus. I'm going to miss him when he's arrested, I really am."
Jimmy Kimmel,"Trump's nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, Dr. Ronny Jackson, his White House doctor, officially withdrew his name from consideration after a lot of bad press. Now Trump has to find someone else to run the VA. Somebody he knows, he wants somebody he trusts. Maybe Colonel Sanders would do it. He's in the military. He knows chickens."
Jimmy Kimmel,"It is ""Avengers"" week on the show. Actually, we're doing a special promotion tonight in honor of “The Avengers.” If you can name all 64 of the heroes who are rumored to be in the new film, you win your virginity back."
