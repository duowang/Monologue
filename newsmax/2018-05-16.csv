Jimmy Fallon,"Today over 2,000 pages of testimony were released about the 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer. The president heard and was like, ""You lost me at 2,000 pages . . . and lost me again at Don Jr."" In the documents, Don Jr. admits he can’t remember if he discussed the Russia investigation with his dad. Meanwhile, his dad admits he can’t remember which one is Eric, and which one is Don Jr. There’s talk that Kim Jong Un might back out of his meeting with President Trump. When asked why, Kim said, “Cuz Trump hears ‘Yanny’ and I hear ‘Laurel.’” Kim Jong Un might cancel his meeting with Trump, where they were supposed to discuss North Korea's nuclear weapons. Trump was like, ""How could someone just pull out of a nuclear agreement?"" And Iran was like, ""I know, it's crazy, right?"" The Royal wedding is just three days away ! Which means in just three days, the world will finally get to see the queen do the Electric Slide. Dunkin' Donuts is celebrating the Royal wedding by offering a heart-shaped donut, and Chili's is offering special burger-inspired hats. Which explains our new slogan: ""America: We Don't Understand Royalty."" There’s a restaurant in New York that’s now serving hummus smoothies. They have zero calories because you suck so hard on the straw you pass out. A new survey found that Green Bay, Wisconsin, is the drunkest city in the U.S. You can tell, cuz no one in Green Bay remembers answering that survey."
