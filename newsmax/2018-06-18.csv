Jimmy Kimmel,"I hope you had a good Father’s Day weekend. The president spent his Father’s Day weekend the same way he does every year. He opens a card and says, ""Who's Eric?"" After two weeks of talking about it, on Saturday I was in Houston to play Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in what we call the Blobfish Basketball Classic. And just like a blobfish, the game was sloppy and within moments we were gasping for air. We played one on one. It took almost an hour to get to six points. Which would be a lot if this was a World Cup soccer game. But it was not. When we agreed to play to 11, I didn't realize that meant 11 o'clock. It went on forever. The game was very rough. There was nothing but fouls the whole game long. I have bruises all over my body. He kept poking me with his hoofs. The game went on so long by the time it was over Jay-Z and Beyoncé had written and produced an entire new album. It's been a dream of mine ever since I was a little boy to play basketball one day against the least popular member of the U.S. Senate. That dream finally came true this weekend."
