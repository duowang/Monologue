Jimmy Fallon,"Tonight, President Trump held a big rally up in Minnesota. It's part of his plan to get as far away from the Mexican border as possible. President Trump went to Minnesota to hold a rally. At one point even his staff was like, ""Let's just push him into Canada and be done with this.” People are really upset about how Trump's handled immigrant families. In fact, while Trump was visiting Congress this week, someone yelled, ""Mr. President, eff you!"" But don't worry, Melania quickly apologized. Trump reversed course today and signed an order to stop separating immigrant kids from their families — and start detaining them together. You know 2018 is rough when people are going, ""All right, families getting locked up in cages together! Yeah!” Dan Scavino, the guy who helps write Trump's tweets, is considering leaving the White House. After thinking long and hard he said, ""I've decided it's time for me to covfefe."" Since a judge approved AT&T's merger with Time Warner, experts say it could open up the door for other big companies to merge. We took a look at some companies we'd like to see merge, just because of what they could rename themselves. I'll show you what I mean. For example, if Saks Fifth Avenue and Citigroup merged, they'd be ""Saks and the Citi."" If Myspace and eBay merged, they'd be ""my bae."" If Chili's and Netflix merged, they'd be ""Netflix and Chili's."" And finally, if Bonobos and Dunkin' Donuts merged, they'd be ""Bo-Dunk-a-Dunk."" Banks are starting to offer services through virtual assistants like Amazon Echo, which backfires when you ask Alexa for your account balance and she just starts laughing."
