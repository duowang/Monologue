Jimmy Kimmel,"Today is National Selfie Say. Finally, a day to take selfies. National Selfie Day, of course, marks the beginning of the high holy days for the Kardashian family, along with the Feast of Saint Botox and Lip-Gloss Hashanah. Today is also the first official day of summer. The first day of summer, the summer solstice as they call it, is the longest day of the year. Every day since Donald Trump was elected is the longest day of the year. President Trump is back on the campaign trail. He had a rally-slash-one-man show in Duluth, Minnesota, last night. It's good for him — whenever he's feeling down he gets a bunch of white people together to watch him scream about CNN. It was an hour-long tirade/hissy fit. He played all the hits. He did “Crooked Hillary,” “MS-13,” “Space Force,” “Lock Her Up.” There was some new material too. He's calling the Russia witch hunt investigation a scam. It's a scam now. He says if the scam gets any bigger they're going to have to start calling it Trump University. While Trump was busy selling hats, his wife, Melania, went to visit migrant children in McAllen, Texas. Did you see what she was wearing? Now keep in mind, she was on her way to see children who’ve been separated from their parents. This is what she wore on a plane ride there — a jacket that said “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” Is the president now tweeting onto his wife’s clothes? The first lady’s getting a lot of flak for the jacket. Her spokeswoman said, “It’s a jacket. There was no hidden message.” Well, no one thought the message was hidden. It’s written in big letters on the back."
