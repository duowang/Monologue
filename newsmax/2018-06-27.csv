Jimmy Fallon,"Today, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced he's retiring, which means President Trump will pick his replacement. When asked which judge he'll choose, Trump said either Adam Levine or Blake Shelton. After 30 years on the bench, Kennedy is retiring from the Supreme Court. He's 81 years old, so he's going to go from sitting around in a robe all day to sitting around in a robe all day. After Kennedy announced his retirement, Donald Trump Jr. sent a tweet. And this is real — it said, “OMG! Just when you thought this week couldn't get more lit… I give you Anthony Kennedy's retirement from #SCOTUS.” Everyone who read that was like, “Well, the word ‘lit’ is ruined.” Trump is in a Twitter feud with Harley-Davidson since they announced that they're moving some jobs overseas. When people first heard Trump was feuding with Harley-Davidson, they just assumed it was another porn star. The cast of the new season of ""The Bachelor in Paradise"" was just announced. When ABC asked if they could take off work for six weeks for filming, they were like, “Oh, we don't have jobs. We'll be there tomorrow.” Oprah made a cameo in this week's episode of ""The Handmaid's Tale."" And by the end of the show, all the handmaids had new cars. A group of shareholders at Facebook might be plotting to get rid of Mark Zuckerberg. And their plan would be way more likely to work if Mark wasn't spying on them using Facebook."
