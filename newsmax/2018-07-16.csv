Jimmy Kimmel,"Today was maybe the strangest of all 542 bizarre days of Donald Trump's reign of error. The president's been to Europe, insulting our allies and rubbing his nipples up against our enemies. On Friday he had tea with the queen — and on Friday, it seemed like a big deal that he walked in front of the queen, which is apparently a no-no, a royal faux pas. You’re not supposed to turn your back on the queen, or pour ketchup in her tea, or take the hat off her head and swat a fly with it. You're not supposed to do any of those things. But that turned out to be nothing compared with what happened in Finland this morning. Helsinki has frozen over. The president of the United States today publicly sided with Russia over our own FBI on the subject of cyberattacks on our election campaign. Trump had a meeting today with his KGB BFF, Vladimir Putin, and in an interview with CBS yesterday he said he was going into this meeting with low expectations. Yeah, we all were. Trump and Putin met one-on-one with only their interpreters in the room for more than two hours. Reportedly, Trump wanted to meet with Putin alone because he didn't want his advisers to see him naked, which is natural. And we probably should have known how this was going to go, based on this, because right off the bat [shows clip] you can see here Trump looks over at Putin as they sit down in front of the media, and gives him a little wink. Yeah, there you go — “Thanks for keeping that tape between us guys.” After Trump was asked to weigh in on Russia’s role as hack master in the 2016 election — something the FBI, the Justice Department, and even Trump’s own secretary of state say happened, without question — Trump finally had the chance to publicly castigate Putin for trying to disrupt our democracy. This is what our commander in chief chose to do: [clip of Trump] “My people came to me, Dan Coats and some others, they said they think it’s Russia. President Putin just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Well, I guess that settles it! If you’re wondering whether Vladimir Putin has an incriminating video of Donald Trump, we now know beyond a treasonable doubt that he does. This wasn't a good day for Donald Trump. We haven't seen an American so owned by a Russian since “Rocky IV.”"
