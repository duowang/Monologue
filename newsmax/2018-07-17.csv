Jimmy Kimmel,"The news today is that our president is a liar, and not even a good one. President Trump today, in an attempt to explain what the Helsinki was going through his cotton candy-covered head when he stood next to Vladimir Putin, of all people, and took sides with Russia over our own American intelligence agencies, now says it was just a tiny little slip-up — even smaller than his fists. [Clip of Trump] "" In a key sentence in my remarks I said the word WOULD instead of WOULDN'T. The sentence should have been, 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't,' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia.'"" I have to say, when you said ""I don't see any reason why it WOULD be Russia,"" for a minute it almost seemed like you were hiding something from us. Like there was something Putin knew about you that you wanted him to keep quiet. Now it all makes sense. Boy, I tell ya, Papa John must be at home right now going, “Wait, you can do that?” What I want to know is, which genius on his team came up with this idea? Who in that administration told him it would be good? I bet it was Melania, she hates him the most. You think about history and presidents, this is like if Bill Clinton had come out and said, ""Wait, no, I meant to say I DID have sexual relations with that woman."" Even when our president was forced to sit in front of the world and make this preposterous claim that he of course knew the Russians tried to meddle with our elections, he couldn’t help but spread the blame around. [clip] ""I have full faith and support for America's great intelligence agencies, always have. I have felt very strongly that while Russia's actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election, let me be totally clear in saying that … I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place. It could be other people also. There's a lot of people out there."" So maybe it wasn't the Russians at all, maybe it was the Canadians, you know? Sneaking around, drilling holes in trees. We don't know what they're up to."
