Jimmy Kimmel,"This is maybe the most important week of the year in the United States. It's Shark Week. Did you know that? I went to church to kick things off because it's important to remember what Shark Week's really about. Shark Week started in 1988, back when sharks were still carrying beepers. And 30 years later, here we are. I don't know how the Discovery Channel keeps coming up with new shark shows. These are real shows: They have “Shaq Does Shark Week.” They've got “Guy Fieri's Feeding Frenzy,” “Cash Cab: Shark Week Edition,” “Naked and Afraid of Sharks,” and “Bear Versus Shark” — which, if you think about that one, in a battle between bear and shark, home field advantage would be huge, right? They get big ratings every year for this. Meanwhile, do you know how many people are killed by sharks every year? I looked this up today. Five. There are five shark fatalities per year in the world. We are deathly afraid of an animal that kills fewer people than Tide pods. The president was up past his bedtime last night, lashing out after the president of Iran said, “America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.” And to that Trump responded with the mother of all caps. He wrote, ""To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!"" I guess that's his idea of Sunday Funday. It's interesting that Trump would react so strongly to typical Iranian rhetoric. These people have the words ""Death to America"" on their license plate frames. This is not an unusual circumstance. This is their thing. So people are wondering why the president would threaten them with nuclear war when he let Vladimir Putin practically run his fingers through his hair. Today we learned that federal prosecutors have 12 conversations secretly recorded by former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen. At least one of those is a conversation with Donald Trump himself. That tape, which was recorded two months before the election, features Cohen and his orange-colored client chatting about paying off a former Playboy model named Karen McDougal. Trump's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said that Trump did nothing wrong and in fact he says this tape is proof that Trump is innocent. Donald Trump could choke a horse to death on ""Fox & Friends"" live, Rudy Giuliani would be on MSNBC an hour later claiming he was hugging it while it died of old age."
