Jimmy Kimmel,"Today, in case you don't have a fun calendar in your house that tells you this sort of thing, we celebrate not just one, but two important holidays. Today is National Tequila Day. A day on which if you have too much fun you might do something you regret. It's also National Cousins Day today, where if you have too much fun you might do something you really regret. It was so hot in LA today. Because of the heat wave local officials are asking LA residents to conserve energy. We all need to do our part. I, for one, after I used my tanning bed this morning, I pulled the plug right out of the wall. It won't go back in ’til I go home. The president was not on the golf course today. He was on Twitter today. He had a special gem this morning. This is an all-timer. He's got a lot of great tweets but today he wrote, “I’m very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election.” Hmm. You don't say. Go on. “Based on the fact that no president has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don't want Trump.” At this point he's just screwing with us, right? Last week Vladimir Putin stood next to him and said, yes, we wanted Trump. Now he says they definitely don't want Trump. Maybe he's being sarcastic and we’re just missing it? I bet he forgot to add a winking emoji next to the message. The Mueller investigation quietly continues. The president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, says Trump would agree to an interview with Robert Mueller as long as there are no questions about obstruction of justice. I love that. It would be like Bill Cosby agreeing to an interview that's only about pudding. Robert Mueller now has a few options. He can accept those terms, which seems unlikely. He can issue a subpoena, when would probably result in a legal battle. Or he can just wait for Trump to go to a rally and blurt everything out himself. According to the latest Gallup poll, Trump's approval rating is the highest it's been since he took office. Between the months of April and July, President Trump's approval rating averaged 41.9 percent or, according to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, 91.9 percent. Since World War II, Trump is only the second elected president to see an improvement in his approval rating during his sixth quarter in office, which sounds really good, except for the fact that the other one was Nixon. This is not going to help the president's approval rating in the state of California. He is planning to roll back regulations put in place by the Obama administration that will allow the state to limit automobile emissions. Which would mean a lot more air pollution, which is exactly what we need around here. Trump's plan is to make the air so toxic immigrants won't even want to come here. And he's doing this so the oil companies can sell more gasoline. Even the auto companies think this is a bad idea. They're like, ""Please, Mr. President, we've already made our plans based on these standards."" Trump is like, ""No, I promised Americans foul, filthy air and that is what I'm going to deliver."" Very sad news to report from the fashion world. President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, announced today she's shutting down her clothing line. I know. I guess I'll have to get my heels at Zappos. Sales of Ivanka Trump merchandise have dropped dramatically since her father became our ayatollah. A number of prominent retailers have stopped carrying her stuff. Wow, a Trump business failing. Who would have ever guessed something like this could possibly ever happen? The good news is no American jobs will be lost because almost every piece of her clothing was made overseas. Ivanka and husband Jared Kushner can focus full-time on whatever the hell it is they've been doing."
