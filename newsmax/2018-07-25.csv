Jimmy Fallon,"CNN released a recording of Trump and his lawyer talking about using hush money to cover up his affair with Playboy model Karen McDougal. In response, Trump was like, “Oh, no! Stormy Daniels might find out I cheated on her.” The tape is from 2016 and you can hear Trump talking about paying off a Playboy model. It was the first time ever that Trump didn't want to hear himself talk. He was like, “Turn it off. Turn it off.” It’s a big story and CNN was the first to release the tape. When he heard, Trump was like, ""Seriously, CNN, what have I ever done to you guys?"" Before the Cohen tape was released, Trump warned people not to believe what they see or hear. Americans are like, “Trust us, we haven't believed anything we've seen or heard since Election Day. So we're good with that. You don't have to tell us.” This fall, Hillary Clinton is going to guest star on an episode of ""Madam Secretary."" If she becomes a big enough TV star, she might have a chance of becoming president. Yelp is going to start showing what restaurants scored on their health inspections. If you want to know how your favorite restaurant did, trust me, no you don't."
