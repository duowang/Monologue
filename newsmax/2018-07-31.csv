Jimmy Fallon,"President Trump now says that he’d be willing to meet with the president of Iran. After Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, Trump said it’s the last meeting he needs to win “Dictator Bingo.” Trump said he’d be willing to meet with Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani “anytime they want.” In response, Putin said, “If you’re trying to make me jealous ... it’s working.” Earlier tonight, Trump flew to Tampa, Florida, for a big rally. But before he left, he put Rudy Giuliani in a kennel so he wouldn’t destroy everything while he’s gone. Right before the rally, Trump took part in a “workforce development roundtable.” And just to mess with Trump, the organizers told him to sit at the head of the roundtable – then watched him walk around in circles for 20 minutes. Facebook is working on a “talent show” feature that would let users record themselves singing and then upload their videos for comments. Facebook even has a catchy name for it: “YouTube.” Police in Maine just pulled over a man who drove a scooter all the way from Massachusetts using his cell phone as a headlight. Police had a lot of questions, mainly, “How’d you get your battery to last that long?!”"
