Jimmy Fallon,"Crazy news out of Florida last night. A man in Tampa was spotted wandering around in public rambling incoherent nonsense about the government. Even crazier, that man was our president. President Trump held a giant rally in Tampa last night with thousands of people in attendance. The crowd was very diverse. It was half white, half Caucasian. Apple is close to becoming the first U.S. company worth over $1 trillion. Then Americans looked at their drawers filled with old iPods, and said, ""Yep. Seems about right."" A guy here in New York swims in the Hudson River every week to prove that it's clean. If you want to meet him in person, services are being held on 43rd Street at the Sherwood Funeral Home. Last night, the New York Mets lost to the Washington Nationals, 25-4. Or as Mets fans put it, ""Sweet. We scored four runs. Awesome."""
