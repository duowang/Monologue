Jimmy Kimmel,"President Trump is busy planning a parade around Veterans Day in Washington, D.C. And remember last month they said this parade would cost $12 million? Turns out the estimate was a little bit off — it was off by about $80 million. According to a Defense official, the parade is now expected to cost $92 million. But don't worry, I'm sure he'll get Mexico to pay for this one, too. According to a new poll, a majority of Republicans believe the news media is the ""enemy of the people."" Which is — we all know the enemy of the people is gluten. Trump found a new way to suppress those who dare criticize him. He took the rare and unusual step of revoking the security clearance held by former CIA Director John Brennan. Trump said he revoked Brennan's clearance because of risks posed by his ""erratic behavior, for making unfounded, outrageous allegations and wild outbursts on the internet."" In other words, he literally described himself. John Brennan was the point person for the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. But that was under the Obama administration. Trump really wants to undo anything Obama did. My sources tell me he wants to have bin Laden brought back to life so he can kill him himself. Today by the way, I don't know if you know this, is National Tell a Joke Day. Here's one. Why did Donald Trump cross the road? OK, first of all, he never crossed the road, that's fake news. Second of all, the people who were accusing him of crossing the road? THEY’RE the ones who crossed the road. Third, Hillary Clinton crossed a bunch of roads and the media never asked about that. Fourth, if he did cross it, it was totally legal. The light was green. Fifth, Donald Trump is a successful businessman who knows more about roads than any of you ever will. Sixth, the stock market is at an all-time high, but all you want to talk about is crossing roads. Seventh, the road-crossing investigation is a politically motivated witch hunt. Eighth, the real question is how do we stop illegal immigrants from crossing the roads? Nine, Vladimir Putin is a good guy. Love to hold hands and cross the road with him. Tenth, Donald Trump crossed the road to make this country great again. So thank you, and no more questions."
