Jimmy Kimmel,"They estimate that more than 16 million Americans traveled by air over the holiday weekend. And here's a fun statistic. They did a study. The germiest place at theairport, the place with the highest levels of virus bacteria, are those plastic security tubs at the TSA. Which is kind of surprising. I mean, who would have ever guessed that the tubs where a million sweaty travelers throw their shoes every day would be full of germs? Nike did something very bold. Nike decided to feature Colin Kaepernick in their 30th anniversary ad campaign. Colin Kaepernick as I'm sure you know was the first NFL player to kneel during the National Anthem to protest police violence against African-Americans. And it cost him — really, it cost him his career in football. No team will sign him. But Nike doubled down and did, which did not sit well with some of their customers. People were so upset they started cutting the Swoosh out of their socks. Finally something dumber than eating Tide Pods. Cutting Swooshes out of your socks is a powerful statement that says, ""I have too many pairs of socks."" This idea of cutting the Nike logo out of your clothes? Why not just burn your money? You already bought the clothes."
