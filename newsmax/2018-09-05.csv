Jimmy Fallon,"Bob Woodward's book is out about the president. It's already a bestseller on Amazon. Between Woodward’s and Omarosa's books, Trump has done something incredible — he's ""Made America Read Again."" Woodward's book is about working for Trump, and it's called ""Fear: Trump in the White House."" That was actually his second choice for a title, cuz ""The Babysitter's Club"" was already taken. Today, The New York Times published an anonymous article from a senior White House official that criticizes Trump. When Trump heard, he screamed, ""Oh my God – the fake news is coming from INSIDE the house!"" A senior official wrote an anonymous op-ed about Trump. Even stranger, the official signed it ""XOXO, Gossip Girl."" Today, confirmation hearings continued for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. At one point, a protester screamed, ""Sham president, sham justice!"" Then security escorted Ruth Bader Ginsburg out of the room. I read that Joe Biden will decide whether he's running for president in 2020 by this January. He's gonna take a coin and say, ""Heads, I run. Tails, I flip again until I get heads."" I heard that the pumpkin spice latte is already on sale at Starbucks. Because when it's 95 degrees outside, nothing's more refreshing than some hot gourd juice."
