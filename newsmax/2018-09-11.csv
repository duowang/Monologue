Jimmy Fallon,"Bob Woodward's book, ""Fear: Trump in the White House,"" hit stores today. It's expected to be a No. 1 best-seller, until another tell-all book about Trump comes out tomorrow. The book is already at the top of the best-sellers list for Amazon and Barnes & Noble. It's been purchased almost a million times on Amazon, and twice at Barnes & Noble. At one store in Washington, people were lined up to buy the book at midnight. It was awkward when Trump drove by, looked out the window, and was like, ""Melania?"" Woodward says Trump's plan to eliminate the federal debt was just to print more money. Before his staff could stop him, Trump ran to Kinko's with a $100 bill and said, ""Make me a trillion copies."" Chief of Staff John Kelly also denied a lot of things Woodward wrote about him. Then Woodward said, ""Kelly is wrong in denying those things."" As you can imagine, Kelly didn't like that. So he responded saying, ""I refute Woodward's denial that my claims that he was lying are true."" Woodward heard that and fought back, saying, ""I reject Kelly's refuting of my denial that claims that he was lying are true."" And then Kelly responded, ""I object to Woodward's rejection of my — wait, I forget. Whose denials are false?"" Then Woodward said, ""Yeah, hold on a second. I'm pretty sure that my rejection of your denial of my refusal is true, right?"" Then Kelly said, ""Wait, there was a refusal? I don't remember a refusal. Who refused what?"" Then Woodward said, ""Wait, I think I got it. You rejected my denial of your claim from my — you know what? Screw it. Let's grab a beer."" Everyone is preparing for Hurricane Florence as it heads toward the East Coast. Today in the Oval Office, Trump spoke about the storm. He really knows what he's talking about: [Trump clip] ""They haven't seen anything like what's coming at us in 25, 30 years. Maybe ever. It's tremendously big and tremendously wet."" [Imitating Trump] ""Don't worry, I'm building an ark. And Mexico is going to pay for it."" Republican officials are worried that Ted Cruz will lose his re-election campaign because he's not likable enough — especially compared to his opponent, Beto O'Rourke. And they might be right about his likability. Look at the way both candidates answer some basic questions. When asked, ""What do you like to do in your spare time?"" O'Rourke said, ""Play guitar."" Ted Cruz said, ""Organize my documents."" When asked, ""What is your plan if you don't win the election?"" O'Rourke said, ""Spend time with my family and keep fighting for what's right."" Ted Cruz said, ""Organize my documents."" I heard that South Korea has stress cafes where people can go to take a break from their day, or as they are known here in America, bars."
