Jimmy Kimmel,"There's a new study from Gallup that says last year, 2017, was the most miserable year on record. According to what's known as the Global Emotions Report, an annual study of people all over the globe, since they started keeping track in 2005, last year was the world's most negative year. Who is to blame for that? ""Young Sheldon,"" they say. The poll said in the last year collectively the world was more stressed, more worried, sadder, and more in pain than ever. This is maybe the first time I can think of where Trump would be right to take all the credit for something. Yesterday Trump made the astonishing claim that his team's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, where almost 3,000 lives were lost, was ""an incredible unsung success."" At 6:50 a.m. this morning he wrote, ""We got A-pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island. Puerto Rico by the way, with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent mayor of San Juan."" He really does have a unique ability to make anything and everything about him. It's remarkable. And he is ready for Hurricane Florence. Ever since he got the call from the National Weather Service, he's been warming up in the bullpen throwing roll after roll of paper towels. Amazon has a new thing going. Amazon is going to sell Christmas trees this the year. Live 7-foot Christmas trees will be available this holiday season. It's not enough that Amazon's putting every store out of business, now they're going after the vacant stores' parking lots, too. It doesn't feel right. It's like the Three Wise Men sharing an Uber to visit the Baby Jesus."
