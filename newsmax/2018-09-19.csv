Conan O'Brian,"Today President Trump met with the victims of Hurricane Florence. The victims said, ""This is the worst thing that's ever happened to us."" Then they talked about the hurricane. Stormy Daniels in her new memoir implies that as an exchange for sex, Donald Trump offered to rig ""The Apprentice"" so she could win. Even worse, Trump made the same offer to Gary Busey — and he took it. Today, of course, is the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. This is the day my Jewish writers are out and my Catholic writers have to Google ""what is Yom Kippur?"" Yesterday a spokesperson for ""Sesame Street"" said that Bert and Ernie do not, I repeat, do not have a sexual orientation. A spokesperson then added, ""But Big Bird is really into Asian chicks."" This is because a writer on ""Sesame Street"" earlier in the week claimed that Bert and Ernie are gay. I always thought it was pretty obvious that Bert and Ernie were gay. Especially based on some of the appearances they have made over the years. For example, they were guest judges on ""RuPaul's Drag Race."" They hosted an annual summer solstice party on Fire Island. They officiated Neil Patrick Harris' wedding. Of course, there was Bert's sham marriage to Liza Minnelli."
