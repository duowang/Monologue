Conan O'Brian,"For his defense Brett Kavanaugh submitted into evidence his summer of 1982 calendar. So far the only thing that it proves about Kavanaugh is he's a weird freak who keeps calendars from 1982. He mentions seeing movies like ""Rocky III"" and ""Grease 2."" I think this hurts his credibility because what idiot would leave hard evidence that they saw ""Grease 2?"" Who would record that? All my papers concerning ""Grease 2"" have been destroyed long ago. SCRABBLE just added two new words to its dictionary. Two new words — ""OK"" and ""Ew."" OK and Ew have been added to SCRABBLE. Coincidentally, OK and Ew are the two words the Senate will use when voting on Kavanaugh. Trump spoke at the U.N. yesterday. Analysts say President Trump treated his U.N. speech yesterday as if he was at one of his rallies. That's how he behaved at the U.N. And he behaved the same way he does at his rallies. Trump said his favorite part was getting the crowd to chant ""Lock her up"" in 17 different languages. President Trump has a brand new technologically upgraded presidential limousine. It's supposed to be very fancy. And the latest with all the technology. For Trump's protection, the limo comes with bulletproof windows and no Twitter. I'm a big fan of scientific advances in the field of medicine. Scientists announced they just developed a robotic caterpillar that can crawl inside you for medical procedures. And for an extra $50, for nonmedical procedures."
