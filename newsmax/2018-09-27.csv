Jimmy Kimmel,"Today was a very emotional day here in the U.S. Millions of Americans watched the much-anticipated testimonies of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. People were crying in front of their televisions — you’d have thought Milo Ventimiglia got killed by a Crock-Pot. The Republican senators were very careful with Dr. Ford. In fact, they were too scared to even question her. They hired a surrogate, a female prosecutor from Arizona. No kidding. They brought her in to do it for them. The way they found this prosecutor is very interesting. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the judiciary committee, didn't like the optics of 11 Republican men questioning one woman so one of his aides suggested, ""Why don't you hire a female lawyer to ask the questions?"" And Grassley was like, ""There are female lawyers?"" Melania Trump has the right idea. With everything that's going on, she's getting the hell out of town. Our first lady is headed overseas next week as part of her ""Be as Far Away From My Husband as Possible"" campaign. She's going to Africa. Melania feels a strong connection to Africa because she's married to the Lyin' King. Did you know that today is Google's 20th anniversary? It's true —Google it. Traditional gift for a 20th anniversary is china. Unfortunately, Google is banned in China, so we can't do that."
