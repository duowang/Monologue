John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 8 Episode 28 Aired on October 31, 2021"
John Oliver,"Welcome, welcome, welcome to “Last Week Tonight”! I’m John Oliver. Thank you so much for joining us. Just time for a quick recap of the week, which has been busy — the G20 met, Covid shots for children were approved, and Facebook , in the midst of damaging revelations from internal documents, made a big announcement:"
John Oliver,"I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta."
John Oliver,"Okay. I mean, that is stupid for several reasons. First, Meta is a terrible name. It belongs in the bad name hall of fame alongside Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse, Noom, and “Last Week Tonight.” But also, you can’t just change your name to cover up the things that you’re ashamed of. Otherwise, years ago, the Pope would’ve responded to the church’s scandals by saying, “good news, guys: we’re no longer the catholic church — say hello to ‘Halo.’ I really think that should fix everything. Don’t worry, we shipped the old name off to another parish.” But we’re going to focus on Congress tonight, which spent the week on two things: first, celebrating Halloween, with Mitt Romney dressing up as Ted Lasso, quoting “Friday Night Lights” for no clear reason, and even sharing biscuits with Kyrsten Sinema, in a move that felt very “homeroom teachers dress as the most popular kids in school.” You think you’re in on it, but you’re very much not. But the other major action concerned Biden’s signature spending plan, which appears to be taking its final shape."
John Oliver,"The president outlining a $1.75 trillion plan to provide free universal pre-k for kids and extend the child tax credit for families. It would also include money for childcare and eldercare and expand Medicare to cover hearing, and it would set aside more than a half-trillion dollars to combat climate change."
John Oliver,"Yeah, there is a lot in build back better — unfortunately, though, none of it includes changing the name to something that doesn’t sound like a gold’s gym promotional offer. But while what’s currently in there is great, it’s hard not to be infuriated by just how much has been cut out. Paid family leave, free community college, and lower prescription drug costs for seniors have all been dropped in negotiations. So some of Biden’s cornerstone promises have now gone, and basically just like that… [Snaps] oh, shit."
John Oliver,"I’m sorry, George. I’m so sorry. I did it again."
John Oliver,"You couldn’t have caught me at a worse time, John. I’m about to go trick or treating."
John Oliver,"Oh, that actually sounds really fun, George. You heading out with your kids?"
John Oliver,"Oh. Okay. Where was I? Oh, that’s right: paid family leave looks to be gone from build back better. And Joe Manchin’s explanation for why he could not support it was pretty weak."
John Oliver,"I want to work with everyone, as long as we can start paying for things. That’s all. I can’t put this burden on my grandchildren. I’ve got ten grandchildren, and I’ll be — I just can’t do it."
John Oliver,"What are you talking about? We can’t have paid family leave because of your grandkids? You can’t just use your offspring as an excuse for your bad decisions. You’re not Ted Cruz. What? His daughters were cold! They wanted a vacation and they were cold. And if cost was the issue, it does not help that a proposed way to raise revenue, a “billionaires tax,” was also scrapped in the final negotiating push, following complaints from, among others, Elon Musk , who tweeted, “eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you.” Which is actually a paraphrase of a famous Margaret Thatcher quote about socialism, and I only hope his next Thatcherism includes my personal favorite of hers: “I am dead and have gone to hell.” But it wasn’t just Elon Musk. Here’s Kyrsten Sinema’s scene partner, Mitt Romney, making his case against the tax:"
John Oliver,"Well, first of all, it’s not a good idea to tell billionaires, “don’t come to America, don’t start your business here,” but number two, you’re gonna tax people not when they sell something, but just when they own it and the value goes up. And what that means is that people are — these multibillionaires — are going to look and say, “I don’t want to invest in the stock market because as that goes up, I’m going to get taxed. So maybe I will instead invest in a ranch or in paintings or things that don’t build jobs and create a stronger economy."
John Oliver,"Okay, not to sound too much like Mitt’s hero Ted Lasso, but Mitt must be made of wood and yapping on the hour, because that man is a cuckoo like a clock. Is he Dora the Explorer on an acid trip? Because he just can’t stop licking boots. And at the risk of stating the obvious here, billionaires already buy ranches and paintings and dinosaur bones they have no use for — why? ‘Cause they have too much fucking money! There literally aren’t enough things on this planet for them to buy. That is why they’re all racing to space. Whoever lands on Mars first gets it. It does seem many politicians would rather prioritize the hypothetical threat to a billionaire’s bank account above all else. Because that’s how our world works now. Politicians tweet about cosplaying as tv’s nicest guy while opposing programs that could fundamentally change people’s lives. And the scariest trick this Halloween might be that some people keep fucking falling for it. And now this."
John Oliver,Welcome to living East Tennessee. I’m Justin Young with Murphy. Clearly we had different ideas when it came to dressing up.
John Oliver,We’ve got a big wrestling tournament downtown.
John Oliver,"I got the chance to speak with James Jude Courtney, who plays Michael Myers in the “Halloween” franchise."
John Oliver,"Swedish chef, can you tell us what our topic is today?"
John Oliver,"57 Degrees high. All right, I’m done with this."
John Oliver,"Halloween is the best time for tricks, treats, child’s play, and clowning around. Even celebrities love twisted pennywise."
John Oliver,"Moving on. Our main story tonight concerns homelessness . And I know that we are by no means the first show to cover this subject — many have tried, none more memorably than the criminally canceled “Tyra Banks Show."
John Oliver,"I wanted to understand what their lives are really like and walk a day in their shoes, no makeup, no lights, nothing but me and the street. I stopped at two kids in the street playing ball. Hi, my name is Tyra. Hi, what’s your name?"
John Oliver,"I mean, there is so much going on there, but I want to focus on Franklin’s face. That is the face of a kid who’s definitely figured out the secret identity of the woman who had a camera crew, looked like Tyra Banks, and introduced herself saying, “My name is Tyra.” But despite Tyra’s best efforts, homelessness is still a huge problem in this country. For the fourth consecutive year, it increased nationwide, with the most recent count suggesting there are over 580,000 people experiencing homelessness in America. But the truth is, it is likely way more than that, because that annual count only includes people that surveyors could find on streets or in shelters on a single night last year — a system that misses countless people. And not just that, experts project the pandemic recession could cause chronic homelessness to increase 49% over the next four years. And with this rise in homelessness has come a corresponding rise in the rhetoric around it — exemplified by segments like this:"
John Oliver,"It’s America, it’s my home. [Ominous music]"
John Oliver,"This used to be one of the crown jewels of Austin. But as you can see, another tent city."
John Oliver,A guy is walking around here with a machete threatening people.
John Oliver,"It started with box cutters as a weapon. Now, we — sadly, we joke that we’re the machete capital of Texas."
John Oliver,"Okay, hold on. I’m not saying that someone walking around with a machete isn’t scary. But you’re making an outlier seem like the norm there and have gone out of your way to make it scarier with visual effects. And you can make anything frightening that way. Here, I’ll show you: here’s a bit of fun — just Shaquille O’Neal dancing with the Jabbawockeez… [Ominous music] Oh, god, oh, no, no, it’s terrifying! Leave him alone, Jabbawockeez! Leave Shaq alone! Run, Shaq! Just run! And look, I know it is easy to criticize fox news for being alarmist. Alarmism is their whole thing, that and airing ads for pills that make your dick go bongo. But the truth is, even some residents of Austin — famously a blue dot in a red state — have said it’s been a struggle to reconcile their feelings about their homeless neighbors."
John Oliver,"Do you think if you had seen this issue happening in another city and it wasn’t happening in your neighborhood, you would feel differently?"
John Oliver,"Once you’re in the middle of it, you change your mind of how you approach this situation. But as your safety declines, so does your compassion. Every — every time I have to pick up human shit, my liberalness just got lowered one more notch."
John Oliver,"Wow. That is very honest. “Every time I have to pick up human shit, my liberalism gets lowered” is quite the sentence. Although I’m surprised I heard it in this context and not in a leaked recording from an Amy Klobuchar staff meeting. Look, again, I am not saying that’s a nice situation to be presented with. But far too often, stories focusing on homelessness are presented solely through the lens of how it affects those with homes. When in reality, it’s obviously the people without them who need the real help. And the demonization of the homeless community in Austin may well have contributed to incidents like this:"
John Oliver,"We had so many people throw glass bottles from the cars at our tents and said, “you all white trash. You all need to get a job. You all need to get housing. You all don’t need to be out on the streets."
John Oliver,"Or some would yell out, “go home.” It’s like, this is technically our home."
John Oliver,"Right. And that’s obviously horrible. Although I will say, no one screaming out of a car window has ever said anything worthwhile. It’s like giving a eulogy through flash mob. The method of delivery alone is just immediately disqualifying. The story of homelessness in this country is grounded in a failure of perception, compounded by failures of policy. So tonight let’s look at the way homelessness is talked about, how the problem is currently being made worse, and what can actually help. And like so many things, the modern version of this issue was turbocharged by Ronald Reagan , who came to power at a time when homelessness was increasing, and made the problem far worse by cutting programs for the poor and slashing housing subsidies by 75%. Making it pretty galling that Reagan regularly made arguments like this:"
John Oliver,"One problem that we’ve had even in the best of times, and that is the people who are sleeping on the grates. The homeless who are homeless, you might say by choice."
John Oliver,"Uh, I’m sorry, “homeless by choice?” Look, there were lots of things from 1984 we could’ve used an undo button for — long duk dong, most of temple of doom, this extremely unfortunate Jello ad, but Reagan’s quarter-assed thoughts on homelessness are near the top of that list. And that notion — that homelessness isn’t related to economic policies, but simply reflects the problems of the individuals experiencing it — still informs the way it’s discussed today. Here’s dr. Drew, of all people, talking to Seth Green, of all people, and pushing back on the notion that the homeless crisis in L.A. might have anything to do with a shortage of affordable housing:"
John Oliver,"No, no. That’s a hoax, that’s a hoax being perpetrated by the government here locally, they need to stop."
John Oliver,"Of course we have housing expense issues, but we just absorbed a million illegal, uh, undocumented immigrants without a home, without a country, without a job, without a penny, and we absorbed them. They found a place to live. It’s a hoax. So it’s a mental health crisis and addiction crisis, full on."
John Oliver,"Oh, okay then. I certainly don’t see why we wouldn’t innately trust dr. Drew confidently mouth-splooging bullshit theories to dr. Evil’s son. But a few notes on what he said there: set aside the nonsense that undocumented immigrants don’t experience homelessness — because experts will tell you that they very much do, they’re just less likely to avail themselves of services because of the whole “undocumented” thing. Instead, let’s address the notion that all this is down to mental health and addiction. Because, yes, many who are homeless do struggle with both those things — and those people are often the most visible — but by no means all of them. Also, in many cases, those struggles can be the result of being homeless and not the cause of it. The truth is, there are many reasons someone might find themselves without housing: medical debt, job loss, fleeing domestic violence, being kicked out of their home because their parents don’t approve of their sexuality, being recently released from prison, or just the overriding fact that housing costs are rising much faster than wages. Currently 70% of all extremely low-income families are spending more than half their income on rent. And only 37 affordable and available homes exist for every 100 extremely low-income renter households. And that’s a startlingly low number, considering just how much this country loves watching tv shows about homes. Little homes. Humongo homes. Homes for ghosts. And homes remodeled by weirdo twins who definitely shower together, to name just a few of them. The point here is, it doesn’t take much for people to suddenly find themselves without stable housing, as this woman found out."
John Oliver,"Two years ago, Priscilla had a full-time job at a health clinic for the homeless. Her husband, Ryan, stayed home to care for their two sons. The youngest has severe autism. They lived on a tight budget and then their landlord raised the rent $150."
John Oliver,"That’s a lot of money for a lot of people that live paycheck by paycheck, and we live like that."
John Oliver,"The family was evicted, and in a place they never imagined: homeless themselves, living in their car."
John Oliver,I work at a homeless clinic and I’m homeless. How the heck does that happen to me?
John Oliver,"Yeah, that is an awful situation to be in. You never want to find yourself suddenly saying, “how did this happen to me?” With the sole exception being if you’re knee deep in Stanley Tucci’s sheets. And even then, why question it? You’re swimming in tooch. Pop a mint. This is gonna be a delight! So despite Reagan’s confidence, there can be not much choice in the matter at all. As for those outward signs of homelessness that raise such alarm, they’re typically the result of public policy choices we’ve made. Remember that woman complaining about human shit? That’s actually a common thread in coverage of the homeless. In L.A., you can find multiple stories about human feces near homeless encampments. But it’s worth knowing there is a reason for that."
John Oliver,"Most of the city’s hundreds of encampments are nowhere near a public toilet. In fact, L.A. has only 16 mobile toilet stations for its 36,000 homeless people. To make matters worse, with no funding for round-the-clock security, the city hauls away these toilets at night, leaving the homeless no choice but to go on the streets."
John Oliver,"What the fuck to all of that. From the amount of public toilet stations available being less than the amount of Bond movies to shuffling those very minimal toilets away like they’re going to turn into a pumpkin at midnight. And while that clip is from just before the pandemic — which prompted city officials to increase toilet stations — there are still currently only 55 accessible 24/7. So the next time you complain about human shit in the street, maybe think about what it would be like if someone padlocked your bathroom every night. You, too, would suddenly be getting really creative, really fast. And it seems the impulse behind many local policies surrounding unhoused people isn’t so much to help them as to punish them for their existence and keep them out of sight. You’re probably familiar with “hostile architecture,” designed to prevent homeless people from sitting and lying on certain property. It’s why you’ll sometimes see spikes under bridges like this, or benches with dividers to prevent anyone lying down. And one city went even beyond architecture."
John Oliver,A debate raging over a Florida city playing children’s music at a park pavilion at night to keep homeless people away. People say the music rotates between “BabyShark” and this song.
John Oliver,"♪ Cheese, cheese ♪ ♪ it’s raining tacos ♪ ♪ raining tacos ♪"
John Oliver,"It’s true, they pumped the song “Raining Tacos” at people when they were trying to sleep. Which is inhumane. No one deserves that. Also, and this isn’t the key point — that song doesn’t deserve that, either. Because it is a certified banger. Take a listen:"
John Oliver,"♪ It’s raining tacos ♪ ♪ out in the street ♪ ♪ tacos, all you can eat ♪ ♪ lettuce and shells ♪ ♪ cheese and meat ♪ ♪ it’s raining tacos ♪ ♪ yum yum yum yum yummity yum ♪"
John Oliver,"Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop. I would love to play you more, but the problem is, this show would then get too fun, I’d spend the rest of the show dancing in the aisles with you, and Ellen would literally kill me. But it’s not just spikes and songs. More and more city ordinances have been put into place criminalizing behaviors associated with being homeless. Over the course of 13 years, city-wide bans on camping have increased by 92%, on sitting or lying by 78%, on loitering and panhandling by 103%, and on living in vehicles by 213%. So when you hear fearmongering about rising crime among the homeless, it’s worth asking if those crimes were actually crimes or just “someone sat down.” Take Kenneth Shultz, a 71-year-old homeless man who told reporters, “sometimes I just get exhausted, and boom, sit down. That’s it. You’re trespassing.” In the nine years he’s been homeless, he’s been charged with trespassing 96 times and has spent one of every three nights in jail. Think about what that means. It means he’s spent three of the last nine years behind bars. In what way is that man being helped? You cannot arrest someone out of homelessness in the same way you can’t sing someone out of bankruptcy. One thing doesn’t remotely lead to the other and you’re just going to end up making things worse. Even if you’re singing this:"
John Oliver,♪ It’s raining tacos ♪ ♪ it’s raining tacos ♪
John Oliver,"Nope! Nope! Turn it off! I’m warning you — Ellen is sharpening her knives as we speak. She’ll do it. It won’t be the first time. And criminalizing homelessness exposes already vulnerable populations to unnecessary interactions with the police. Unhoused people of color are more likely to be cited, searched, and have property taken than white people experiencing homelessness. And those with multiple marginalized identities, like LGBTQ+ people of color, are even more vulnerable to these laws. And if you’re thinking, “hold on, why don’t homeless people just go to shelters?” There can be a lot of problems with that. Some cities simply don’t have enough beds for everyone. In Oakland, for example, in 2019, there were 457 beds available for more than 4,000 unhoused people. Meaning they couldn’t provide everyone with a bed even if they Willy Wonka’d the situation. And if I may, I’d actually like to pause at this point for a quick tangent. So put 40 seconds on the clock, please. Regarding this: I don’t mind Charlie’s grandparents sleeping in one bed. Everyone always asks, “but what about when they have to fuck? Do they fuck separately or all do it together?” To which I say, I don’t care, and I hope so! They’re not related by blood. They’re related by their children’s marriage. It’s not their fault they have to share one rickety bed. Grandpa George is going to want to make love to grandma Georgina. They’ve shared a life together. And grandpa joe is obviously going to want to get it in grandma Josephine. That’s the mother of his child. But at a certain point, if you don’t invite the couple sleeping in the same bed to join in, it’s just rude. So the next time you talk shit about Charlie bucket’s elder’s sexual proclivities, ask yourself this: are they the problem? Or were you raised in a puritanical society that shames any sexual deviation from the “norm”? [Timer dings] oh, that’s my time. That’s my time. I’ve said my piece. Back to the sad stuff. The point is, some cities don’t have enough shelter beds. And even in those that have many, like here in New York, they’re not always an option for everyone. Some might not want to split up their family or part with their pets or are simply wary of bringing their only possessions around a room full of strangers. But also, the key problem with saying “why don’t they just go to shelters?” Is that shelters are only a stopgap solution. Because you don’t live in a shelter, you just sleep in one, as this woman points out:"
John Oliver,"It’s very, very rough. I would rather stay on the streets. And this is why I understand when I see a lot of homeless people, why they’re on the streets. The shelter degrades you. I work part-time. I went from a full-time job to a part-time job, being in the shelter, because there’s too much going on. I have to be in at 8:00 every night. If I’m not in at 8:00, I lose that bed. You wake up at 5:00, you have to be out of there by 7:00, regardless."
John Oliver,"Yeah. An 8:00 p.m. Curfew and a 7:00 a.m. Kick out the door. So if “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps” involves working nights, I’m sorry, you’re shit out of luck. And if you’re thinking, “no, john, surely a shelter eventually helps people get back on their feet. Everything worthwhile in life takes time — I read that on a pillow once.” Well, think again, because just look what happened when the person who filmed that woman caught up with her almost eight years later:"
John Oliver,"You talked about going in and out of the shelter system, and that’s still happening."
John Oliver,"And that’s still happening. They place you, they let you go, they move you, they let you go, they get your money from the government, they let you go, and you’re still misplaced."
John Oliver,"Yeah, the shelter system has done nothing to change her circumstance. And I’ll be the first to admit here, it’s impossible for me to understand just how hard that cycle is. I’ve been lucky enough to have always lived in an apartment or house or, most recently, an infinite white void run by an abusive landlord. That was hard in its own way, but it was nothing compared to a potentially life-or-death game of musical beds. So if all we’ve mentioned so far tonight — poking homeless people with spikes, blasting them with music, and locking them up — doesn’t solve the problem, what does? Well, this housing advocate has a bold new idea."
John Oliver,The solution is simple. This is what the solution is. This is only thing that ends homelessness. It’s this right here: house keys.
John Oliver,"Exactly. House keys. In other words, give the homeless homes. It’s the solution you’ve probably been shouting at your tv for the past 15 minutes, or let’s be honest, shouting at your laptop, or, if we’re being really honest, shouting at your phone during your Monday morning shit. And if you are annoyed I wasted your time taking the scenic route here, let me make it up to you with another excellent clip from “the Tyra banks show."
John Oliver,"There is some context for that, but the truth is, it honestly wouldn’t make it make any more sense. Now some will say, sure, giving the homeless homes is an obvious solution, but before that, they need to be sober and have a job. But it’s just not that simple. Set aside that dealing with sobriety or your mental health issues is hard enough when you are not living on the streets. Getting a job is often, if not contingent on, at least aided by having an address. That is why advocates endorse an approach called “housing first.” It prioritizes helping people get a place to live, but also offers support like mental health and addiction services. We’ve actually tried a version of this with homeless veterans, and it had some real success:"
John Oliver,"The first step of this new model is a permanent house, funded mostly at government expense, with services then added around the resident. It’s called permanent supportive housing. And that’s what Lendell Seay found himself in. Seay lives in this complex that houses only formerly homeless veterans. While there is no firm program that he has to follow, he has access to support services, including on-site case managers, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, and even a community garden."
John Oliver,"It feel good. Sometimes, I walk around the apartment and no tv or nothing on and just singing for no reason at all. And then I catch myself doing it and I start to laugh, and I say, “you must be going crazy now.” But I’m just happy, it feel —"
John Oliver,"That is a very nice thing to see. It’s like two babies hugging or four grandparents absolutely railing each other. It’s something that just fills you with hope. And thanks to this housing first strategy, the number of homeless veterans dropped from 74,000 in 2010 to 38,000 in 2018, a near 50% reduction. And supportive housing is just one version of what this can look like. For those recently made homeless, rapid rehousing provides short-term rental assistance and services to help people get back on their feet quickly. And look, housing first programs clearly require significant resources and funding, but it is not like our current approach is cheap. One study in Florida that tracked a decade’s worth of spending on just 107 chronically homeless people found that, just between money spent on incarceration and emergency medical treatment, their communities and local governments had spent an average of just over $31,000 per person per year, when the estimated cost of providing them with permanent supportive housing would’ve only been around $10,000 per year. So if your argument against housing for the homeless was purely monetary, congratulations, your concerns have been answered. Also, a pre-congratulations for being visited by three ghosts this upcoming Christmas eve. But funding isn’t the only issue here. A huge obstacle in implementing these sorts of programs is opposition from local residents. It is the “nimby” problem — “not in my back yard” — and it happens everywhere. Take Claremont, California, where new developments offering affordable housing, including those geared to the homeless, were proposed, only to encounter fierce community pushback like this:"
John Oliver,You don’t need to put it in our backyard.
John Oliver,"Well, it’s just going to go downhill if you bring all that in. All that riff-raff. I don’t need it."
John Oliver,It’s just not the right place. I agree that they need help. I agree that they need to find a location. But Claremont is not the location to be had.
John Oliver,"How is that going to impact crime? How is that going to impact the businesses out here? Is there low-income? Are they going to be spending money at the sushi place or, you know, or not?"
John Oliver,"Oh, no! Not the sushi place! I didn’t realize a prerequisite for housing was a willingness to spend Friday nights deep throating nigiri. As for the guy saying, “I agree they need to find a location, just not here” — where then? Because you do get just because someone leaves your sight doesn’t mean they stop existing, right? It’s a concept we all learn pretty early, after about eight months of absolutely terrifying games of peek-a-boo. And Claremont’s by no means an isolated example. In North Texas, local residents mobilized against a proposed affordable housing project, which had units set aside for residents using “housing choice,” or “Section 8” vouchers — basically, rental subsidies for low-income or homeless individuals. And here’s how one opponent of the project explained herself."
John Oliver,"The lifestyle I feel like that is — goes with Section 8 is usually working single — either single moms or people who are struggling to keep their heads above water. And it’s not — I feel so bad saying that, but it’s not — it’s just not people who are, I guess, of the same class as us, which sounds bad, but I don’t mean that in a bad way."
John Oliver,You think that you maybe are stereotyping the folks?
John Oliver,"Oh, I totally am, 100%! It’s not — it works both ways. I — I’m definitely not a racist and I’m not bigot, but, um, I — I think I hold a little bit of a stigma against people who are different."
John Oliver,"Okay, some quick corrections there: you don’t feel that bad saying it. The things you’re saying are things racists and bigots say. And saying “I’m not a racist or a bigot” but also saying you have “a stigma against people who are different” isn’t necessarily splitting hairs, but it’s definitely segregating them. And while that woman lives in a conservative area of Texas, plenty of the places you’ve seen tonight — and plenty of the places where these sentiments run deepest — are deep-blue liberal cities. The truth is, some of you watching this right now may share some of those views. And if you do, I implore you to take in every word of this formerly unhoused mother, Keanakay Scott, who wrote a letter to the Nimbys in her hometown."
John Oliver,"You wear your bias like a badge of honor when you see my history. You judge me for having children, for needing assistance. You hate me for wanting the stability you take for granted. And why? Because you didn’t like looking the other way when you saw me on the street? Or is it simply because I make you uncomfortable, and your discomfort is enough to disqualify a person from the American dream?"
John Oliver,"Exactly. She’s absolutely right. It is not the housed’s comfort that needs to be prioritized right now. So if you’re wondering why homelessness continues to get worse in this country, one reason is that there are a lot of people — even liberals — who believe that homelessness is a personal failing, poverty can be avoided, and their own good fortune makes them not only better than the unhoused but more worthy of comfort. It is basically Reagan’s attitude from a whole foods crowd. And I don’t want to oversimplify the logistics involved here. It will take a massive commitment in infrastructure, funding, and resources. But the very first step here is a collective change of perceptions. Basically, we need to stop being dicks and assuming that the unhoused are a collection of drug addict criminals who’ve chosen this life for themselves, instead of people suffering the inevitable consequences of gutted social programs and a nationwide divestment from affordable housing. I really hope that is one of the two key things that sticks in your head from tonight’s show — the other, of course, being this:"
John Oliver,"That’s our show, thank you so much for watching! We’ll see you next week. Good night!"
