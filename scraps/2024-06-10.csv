John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 11 Episode 14 Aired on June 9, 2024"
John Oliver,"Welcome, welcome, welcome to “Last Week Tonight!” I’m John Oliver. Thank you so much for joining us! It’s been a busy week! Mexico elected its first woman president. Israel bombed a U.N. school sheltering displaced Palestinians, and a day later, bombed another one. And in Ohio, their state legislature met to consider a ban on public drag performances, at which one local official described what he felt were objectionable signs at a local Pride event. And I cannot recommend enough that you watch the guy behind him."
John Oliver,"The second example is a sign which read, and I quote, “I love vagina. Nom, nom, nom, nom.” Also at this event were vendors present who were selling inappropriate items depicting male genitalia, plush pillow penises, and penis-tip squeeze balls."
John Oliver,"That is excellent, both how hysterical that guy is and also how utterly serious the official remains. “Why are you laughing? Because I said ‘I love vagina. Nom, nom, nom, nom’? That’s funny to you? Me saying ‘I love vagina. Nom, nom, nom, nom’? Well, you know when you won’t be laughing? When a baby says it."
John Oliver,"But we’re going to turn to Paris, ethically non-monogamous London, which is currently getting ready to host the Olympics next month, meaning venues are getting prepped and the mascots are getting ready to promote it. And you might be wondering “What the fuck are those things?” They look like anime clitorises. They shouldn’t be at the Olympics. They should be at a Pride event in Ohio holding a sign that says “I love vagina. Nom, nom, nom, nom.” But the truth of what they are is somehow even stupider."
John Oliver,"The Paris organizing committee for the games recently unveiled the Phrygian cap, also known as the liberty cap. The brand director for Paris 2024 says the Phrygian cap is a symbol familiar to generations of French people. Organizers said they didn’t want to choose an animal or other creatures but something that encompassed an ideal."
John Oliver,"Yeah, they’re anthropomorphized French hats! And it’s bad enough to choose a hat. But this one, France? What about the beret? The kepi? The Dartagnan? The Napoleon? The wig? Any of them are better than this Papa Smurf shit."
John Oliver,"And for all the talk of “encompassing an ideal,” a lot of their Olympic preparation has fallen well short of that, from clearing camps of migrants from the city to relying on undocumented workers to construct the venues. It is no wonder there’ve been protests featuring burning Olympic rings, especially when you consider that, at a time when some in the French government are advocating for austerity measures, they’re spending billions to host these games. And some have zeroed in on one decision in particular as symbolic of the folly: the choice to have both the opening ceremony and some of the swimming events take place in the Seine. It’s a charming idea, with the slight hitch that the Seine is fucking disgusting. It’s been polluted for literally centuries, as this clip points out, with some odd specifics."
John Oliver,"The Seine has been subjected to pollution for much of its storied history. In the 16th century, bodies of slaughtered Protestants were thrown in the waterway. It was declared biologically dead in the 1960s and more recently, industrial waste and raw sewage have been dumped into the river."
John Oliver,"Yeah, to make any good urban waterway, you really need three things: industrial waste, raw sewage, and slaughtered Protestants. You might think you can skip the Protestants, but everyone will tell you that if you do it just won’t taste the same. And I know this is besides the point, but this painting doesn’t feel serious enough to be a depiction of a religious massacre. It seems more like a page from “Where’s Waldo?” And you know what? There he is! There’s Waldo! His corpse is in the Seine! He refused to believe in transubstantiation!"
John Oliver,"The Seine actually acts as an overflow for the city’s sewer system, leading it to occasionally look like this, which obviously isn’t great. And France will say it’s mounted a $1.5 billion cleanup project, including a 13-million gallon overflow tank, though there are questions of whether that’ll make it safe enough to swim in. But both the mayor of Paris and President Macron have insisted that it will, making this bold promise."
John Oliver,"Yes, I plan to swim in the Seine. That is clear. And I am preparing for this moment which will be historic. If the president wants to come, he will obviously be welcomed too."
John Oliver,"Now… if I may quote anyone swimming in the Seine, that’s clearly a pile of shit. But also, why would he make that promise? Best case scenario, we get traumatized by seeing him in a swimsuit. Worst case, we have to see the President of France get tangled up in plastic six-pack rings like a fucking seagull. But the mayor has given a date, saying she’ll swim in the Seine on June 23rd. And it might have been a mistake for her to advertise that. Because if there’s one thing France does well, it’s protests. And it seems like a pretty imaginative one has emerged."
John Oliver,"A collective has formed! I swear to you, I will shit in the Seine on June 23! People really are geniuses! Johnny Baudelaire tweeted, “As of now, I’ve stopped taking shits. I’ve been holding it in for exactly one month, and on June 23, I’ll go to Paris to unleash 70 kilograms of shit into the Seine.” #IShitintheSeine."
John Oliver,"It’s true. Yeah, there’s a plan for a mass shitting in the river on June 23, in what’s being called a defecation flashmob, which is, I believe, also the collective noun for a group of pigeons. There’s even a website where you can find out, if you live upriver from Paris, exactly when to shit in the Seine to make sure your contribution arrives there on the 23rd. Now, the mayor, maybe in response, is saying she’s likely pushing her swim back to June 30th. But why would you give an exact date again? This is an issue on which, I guarantee you, the French do give two shits."
John Oliver,"All of this is such a great encapsulation of the spirit of France, and there’s still time to change their Olympic mascot. Because what symbolizes French defiance more than a giant turd smoking a cigarette, bathing in the river, waiting for a horrified mayor? And you know what? If you have to add a stupid hat to that? I will allow it."
John Oliver,"Moving on. Our main story tonight concerns the ocean, the only place where you can pee in full view of a family of four without it being a sex crime. The ocean’s a gigantic place, absolutely chock-full of weirdos."
John Oliver,"They are simply otherworldly floating in the dark in what’s known as the oxygen minimum zone about 3,000 feet below the surface. In these depths, the researchers have found this vampire squid, rare brightly colored jellyfish, and also this barrel eye fish with a transparent domed head revealing upward-facing eyes. It’s been seen by humans less than 10 times."
John Oliver,"Yeah, to be honest, good. I’m glad that fish hasn’t been seen much. It’s a butter face. And I don’t mean that in the horribly offensive way, I just mean it has a body I’d like to fuck if it weren’t for its fugly face. I’d say that fish was beautiful on the inside but we can all see in there, and it isn’t. When you see creatures like those, you begin to understand why one marine scientist has said, “It’s like Dr. Seuss down there,” which is true. It’s just like his famous book “One Fish, Two Fish, Holy Shit, Is That A See-Through Fish?” There’s also wonders like the flapjack octopus, which can get flat like a pancake, this transparent thing called a unicum, a Dumbo octopus, named for its stupid little ears, whatever the fuck this is, and the carnivorous harp sponge. And if you’re thinking, “Hold on, what are those tiny balls on the end?” Good question! They are basically testicles, my friends. Apparently, the swollen balls at the tip of the sponge’s upright branches produce packets of sperm. Nature is incredible and it is disgusting."
John Oliver,"But we’re going to talk about a specific part of the Pacific Ocean tonight called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone , or the CCZ. It’s in an area between Mexico and Hawaii that’s nearly the size of Europe. It’s also the deep ocean, where “water temperatures can reach 0 degrees Celsius and there is virtually no light.” And yet, for such a seemingly inhospitable place, there’s still an incredible amount of life down there, as this oceanographer will tell you."
John Oliver,"When we go out and collect a sample on the seafloor, we collect hundreds of new species."
John Oliver,He told us he was surprised at how much life could survive three miles deep. His expeditions to the CCZ have turned up fantastical creatures like this squidworm or a fluorescent sea cucumber dubbed a “gummy squirrel.
John Oliver,"Oh, I like that a lot. In fact, I love that gummy squirrel so much I want to cover it in sour dust and eat a bag of them while watching Nicole Kidman talk about the magic of the movies."
John Oliver,"A study last year found there may be more than 8,000 species living in the CCZ and of the 5,500 so far detected, only 438 have been identified. But this story is going to be less about marine life in the deep ocean and more about what else is down there with them. Specifically, that the ocean floor is full of deposits of critical minerals. Some are in the crusts of underwater mountains or around hydrothermal vents and some—the ones we’ll be focusing on tonight—take the form of potato-shaped nodules, little lumpy spheres formed over millions of years. Basically, a nucleus, like a bit of bone or sand, slowly accrued a buildup of metals, at a rate of around a millimeter every million years or so."
John Oliver,"Those nodules now line some parts of the deep ocean floor and contain valuable metals like nickel and cobalt, which can be used for things like batteries for electric cars. So obviously, people are very interested in getting their hands on them."
John Oliver,"It looks like a cobbled road with all these little nodules packed densely against one another across this entire area. Unique little golden nuggets. Is this the gold or oil of the 21st century? I definitely think that these black nuggets are going to be an essential part of our ability to transition to what we want to do at the end of the day. Without these, we are not going to be able to achieve our goals and objectives."
John Oliver,"Yeah, those nodules could be incredibly valuable even though, to be honest, they look more like what you bring to the vet when your Pomeranian is severely constipated. And deep-sea mining companies are now scrambling to get their hands on what they love to describe as a battery in a rock. And the head of one company leading the charge, “The Metals Company,” has gone on outlets like “60 Minutes” to argue that those nodules could end up saving the planet."
John Oliver,"I love the fact that they are the way we’re going to get away from fossil fuels. I love the fact that in these, are all the metals we need to go and build those batteries. I mean, it’s– it’s– it’s the most amazing coincidence that I’ve ever encountered. Mother Nature made these nodules–"
John Oliver,"It’s like, okay, you guys, you’ve messed up planet Earth. Come and get me."
John Oliver,"That’s an appealing pitch. I, too, like the idea of a Mother Nature who knows we fucked up but who’s giving us one last chance to make things right, and in return, all we have to do is go down on her. That is very gracious of her. That man is named Gerard Barron , and he’s an actual person, and not– as you may’ve thought– ChatGPT’s answer to “Make Sean Penn the most Sean Penn.” He’s positioned himself at the forefront of this industry, and reportedly once hired a marketing firm that portrayed him as an Australian Elon Musk. Although he denies that, insisting he’d never compare himself to Musk, as he considers him a once-in-a-generation genius, which gives you some hint of where this story’s about to go."
John Oliver,"Barron stresses he’s the real deal. His company says it’s secured access to enough metal to power 280 million electric vehicles, equivalent to the entire fleet of cars in the U.S. And he’s projecting they could start commercially exploiting the deep sea as early as 2026. But the place he’s planning to do that is the CCZ, even though it’s one of the few remaining environments on Earth that’s close to pristine. And extracting those nodules could do irreparable damage. So before we stand back and watch this guy’s company throw open the door to commercial-scale plunder, it might be worth looking at what exactly he’s proposing to do and whether it’s actually worth doing at all. So tonight, let’s talk about deep-sea mining ."
John Oliver,"And to hear Barron tell it, mining these nodules is really just a simple matter of scooping them off the floor."
John Oliver,"They literally lie on the ocean floor just like this, like golf balls on a driving range."
John Oliver,Sits on the seafloor like golf balls on a driving range.
John Oliver,"Well, think of it as a golf driving range that has not much grass, it’s just golf balls."
John Oliver,It’s a little bit like walking onto the golf driving range littered with balls.
John Oliver,"Oh, they’re just golf balls you can pick up! That sounds easy until you remember they’re 15,000 feet underwater. The difficulty of picking up golf balls really depends on where they are. If they’re on a driving range, sure, it’s no big deal. If they’re resting on a grizzly bear’s dick, then you know what? Maybe take a mulligan."
John Oliver,"And Barron’s partners also paint a very gentle picture of what the extraction process will look like, with renderings of a collector vehicle delicately sucking them up like a vacuum cleaner. But that massively undersells the damage this could do, starting with the fact that researchers estimate at least 30% to 40% of species down there live directly on the nodules themselves. But that’s just the beginning. Because while Barron has called the floor of the CCZ a desert and likes to talk about how little biomass there is down there. Just because the creatures are small, it doesn’t mean they are not important to the ecosystem around them. Experts have a very different reaction when holding one of those nodules:"
John Oliver,"This is its own little habitat. We get millions of different species living on these nodules, everything from microbes, some of which live nowhere else other than on and in these nodules, all the way to much larger animals. And that means that if the nodules were to be removed, they would certainly impact these species and potentially lead to long-lasting, if not irreversible impacts to this ecosystem."
John Oliver,"Exactly. It could have irreversible impacts for everything from microbes to gummy squirrels. And I literally only just learned they existed. I don’t want them to be destroyed unless I’m absolutely housing a family-size bag of them. And just to be clear– it’s not just the impact of removing the nodules themselves. It’s the damage the mere act of mining itself will do, because scientists worry that those gigantic vehicles could do much broader harm."
John Oliver,"It will drive around mining the nodules. But during this process, it will also collect about 5 to 30 centimeters of sediment from the seafloor. And this will all pass through the vehicle. The nodules will be retained, but the sediment will come out of the back of it. And that will create a sediment plume, a bit like an underwater sandstorm. The nodules will be loaded onto a transport ship which will then take them back to land for processing, but the unwanted sediment and seawater from the cleaning process will be released back into the ocean. And that could either happen close to the seafloor or at much shallower depths closer to the surface. And that creates a secondary plume, but this time likely containing fragments of metal."
John Oliver,"Yeah, so it’s two massive clouds of sediment and metal. Which can do a lot more damage than you might think. They have the potential to bury fields of the nodules, choke the filters with sponges and other enemies, even those living outside the mining zone and obscure bioluminescence that squid and fish used to hunt and mate. Basically, it could fuck everyone’s shit up. Think less “gently lifting golf balls off the driving range,” and more a scene from “Dune 3: Even More Sand."
John Oliver,"And while the Metals Company says research it commissioned shows the damage will be minimal, vastly more research it didn’t commission suggests otherwise. One long-running study sent equipment down to simulate the extraction of nodules in 1989 and returned periodically to see how the ecosystem had changed. And even 26 years later, it had failed to return to its previous state. So even after an entire Kylie Jenner, the ecosystem hadn’t recovered. And you should know our interest in these creatures isn’t just for ethical or academic reasons. Ocean organisms can lead to radical advances in medicine. In the last 50 years, scientists have discovered more than 10,000 new chemical compounds from sponges. In fact, a number of drugs, from the world’s first medication to treat HIV to a drug for breast cancer to the COVID treatment remdesivir, owe their origins to sea sponges. And many more, including many derived from deep-sea creatures, are in the works."
John Oliver,"And given that the whole reason for doing this, as Barron insists, is to protect the planet, it’s worth noting that the ocean actually absorbs about a third of all the carbon dioxide we produce. In fact, a type of bacteria found in the CCZ a few years ago was found to be taking up large amounts of carbon dioxide and could be playing an important part of the deep-sea carbon cycle. So you want to be absolutely sure that’s not jeopardized by deep-sea mining, and we’re not sure about that at all."
John Oliver,"So, if deep-sea mining could be this risky, what rules are in place to mitigate it? Well, unfortunately, in most of the ocean, none. And to understand why, you need to know a little bit about a tiny U.N. affiliated agency called the International Seabed Authority , or the ISA. Basically, it’s in charge of the seabed in international waters and oversees an area covering around 54% of the total area of the world’s oceans. The ISA calls it “The Area,” which is just a wildly lazy placeholder name, it’s like calling a man who’s super “Superman” or calling a show where you talk about last week that night “Last Week Tonight.” It’s just completely devoid of imagination."
John Oliver,"The ISA was created in 1982, as part of the U.N.’s Law of the Sea Treaty. And you should know while 168 countries signed onto that treaty, the U.S. recognized it but never ratified it, partly because of pressure from conservatives in the U.S., like Phyllis Schlafly , who spent years ranting about what the treaty would do."
John Oliver,"It is global socialism. It is world government. It is worse than the United Nations. We would have one vote, the same vote as Cuba, but we wouldn’t even have the veto. This International Seabed Authority would have the power over us, nine-tenths of the world’s surface. It would have sovereign control over all the riches at the bottom of the oceans."
John Oliver,"You know what? She seems fun. And she pretty much checked all the boxes of a deranged conservative take: fearmongering about global socialism, shit-talking the U.N., and shoehorning Cuba in for good measure. But it wasn’t just her. Reagan refused to sign the treaty while he was president because of his objections to its limits on future seabed mining. And I know I talk a lot on this show about the bad stuff Ronald Reagan did, so to balance that out, I do want to mention something positive he did for the planet. In 2004, and this is true, he died."
John Oliver,"But the truth is, the ISA’s far from the all-powerful world government Schlafly warned about. It’s actually struggled to agree to a regulatory framework to govern deep-sea mining. And on one hand, that makes sense. It’s a complex issue, exacerbated by the fact that more than 80% of the world’s oceans remain unexplored and unmapped, and there’s still so much we don’t know about how mining could affect it. But many of the agency’s critics are also concerned that it’s beholden to mining interests, with one of its top rule-making bodies having members who also work for mining contractors."
John Oliver,"Now, it hasn’t given out any exploitation licenses to actually commercially mine the ocean floor yet, but it’s given out dozens of so-called exploratory licenses, which are the first step toward doing that. And just watch as this reporter asks the head of the ISA, Michael Lodge, a pretty revealing question:"
John Oliver,The ISA’s job is to decide which parts of the seafloor in international waters can be mined by which country. But some have asked whether it’s paying enough attention to the environmental consequences.
John Oliver,"Have you ever, in the ISA’s history, rejected a license application?"
John Oliver,"No. So far, no license application has been rejected."
John Oliver,Wow. A 0% rejection rate. It’s not ideal that a body responsible for something as important as protecting the deep sea has lower standards than the University of Phoenix.
John Oliver,"So that’s not great. Nor is it great that Lodge, who, remember, heads the agency tasked with regulating seabed mining, not only appeared in a promo video for Barron’s company but has said, “I think that deep seabed mining is an essential component of the global vision for a sustainable world.” I’d say Lodge is a cheerleader for mining interests, except that when Radio New Zealand referred to him as a cheerleader for mining interests, he threatened a defamation lawsuit. So I’ll just say this. He’s a cheerleader for mining interests. I’m just kidding. But he is, though. He definitely is."
John Oliver,"And Lodge, who, by the way, isn’t a scientist, but a lawyer, has made it clear in interviews that he’s irritated by environmentalists who want clean energy but oppose deep-sea mining, arguing, “To say, ‘Don’t harm the ocean,’ it is the easiest message in the world, right? You just have to show a photo of a turtle with a straw in its nose.” And yeah, no shit, Michael, because that’s a disturbing image. If you see a turtle with a straw in its nose, it’s either in distress, or you’re watching a special episode of Ninja Turtles about drug abuse."
John Oliver,"Even those who’ve worked for the ISA have reservations about its priorities. One marine geologist who served as its top environmental official has said the ISA is not fit to regulate any activity in international waters. “It is like to ask the wolf to take care of the sheep.” And I really don’t want to be a fact-checky bitch about it, but the thing is, a sheepdog is actually a domesticated wolf. So the descendants of wolves literally do care for sheep every day. It’s a hard job, and they do it well. I’m so sorry to correct you, but I can’t help it. It’s who I am as a person. And I don’t like it either."
John Oliver,"The thing is, right now, Barron’s Metals Company seems set to use the weakness of that regulatory agency to barrel into the CCZ, potentially setting a precedent for far more deep-sea mining throughout the ocean. And the way the company’s doing it is actually pretty clever. Because the ISA is set up in a way that’s theoretically meant to protect the interests of small developing countries. The way it works is, when larger countries find “worthy locations” to mine in, they have to hand over half that territory to the ISA, which then sets them asides as reserved areas for less developed countries to start their own projects. Those countries can then sponsor a mining company to develop that area for them."
John Oliver,"That’s what’s happened with Barron’s company, which has been sponsored by a few tiny Pacific island nations, among them Tonga and Nauru , on what appear to be very favorable terms. One Tongan community leader has said it’s accepting a fee that amounts to less than half of 1% of the firm’s total estimated value of the mined material. And Barron seems very aware of how much leverage his company has, saying, “If you look at a nation like Nauru, and if you ask them, ‘Well, what are your other economic development opportunities?’ There’s not a long list."
John Oliver,"Although there’s a reason for that, and it has to do with the fact that Nauru has been repeatedly exploited by outsiders. It spent years being plundered for its main natural resource, phosphate, the mining of which was so destructive, Nauru has been called “the most environmentally ravaged nation on Earth.” Since then, they’ve grasped for financial lifelines, from allowing themselves to be used as a money-laundering haven, to letting Australia effectively remake the island into its own detention center, to the fact it even got talked into becoming the chief backer of a London musical based on the life of da Vinci called “Leonardo the Musical: A Portrait of Love,” about an affair between da Vinci and the Mona Lisa, which is today considered one of the biggest disasters in the history of London theater. It closed within a month, and the Nauruan government lost what would today be $7 million."
John Oliver,"And you might think, “How bad could that musical be?” Well, here’s an extract of a song, sung by Leonardo’s male lover about his jealousy of the Mona Lisa."
John Oliver,"Look. I’m no Sondheim, but even I know a song about the Mona Lisa that uses the word “portrait” while sounding like “Les Mis” on quaaludes has got “historic bomb” written all over it."
John Oliver,"And now, Nauru has partnered with Barron’s Metals Company. And while he insists, “Nauru is no one’s puppet, I can assure you,” there’s a clear power disparity between an international mining firm hoping to make billions of dollars, and an environmentally-ravaged island with a population of just 12,000 people. And Nauru’s now clearing a path for the Metals Company to start mining. Very basically, it triggered a mechanism whereby the ISA must start accepting deep-sea mining applications, even if standards aren’t set. And later this summer, Barron’s company plans to submit an application to be the first to actually commercially mine, and he seems pretty confident it’s going to be approved, telling investors he expects to commence production at the end of the first quarter of 2026."
John Oliver,"And with the way he’s talking, it can feel like deep-sea mining is a done deal. And he seems aware of how bad the optics are, but doesn’t seem that troubled by it."
John Oliver,"I mean, it is quite sci-fi, and if this were a film, you know, I’m sorry to say you’d probably be the bad guy in this. You’d be the one that’s exploiting it, because there is a sort of gut feeling that we are exploiting something that we should be leaving alone. Do you kind of understand that?"
John Oliver,"I think it depends if you’re a glass half full or a glass half empty person. Personally, I’m a glass half full and I think this is the solution to the climate crisis."
John Oliver,"But how is that a reassuring answer? If someone says “You remind me of the bad guys from movies. Not just one movie, but all of them,” I’d hope an actual good guy would have a more robust response than “Oh, I dunno, 6 of one, half a dozen of the other, I’m an optimist!” But is all of this even worth it? Barron will say that it is, arguing it’s better than the alternative– mining on land– which can indeed do incredible damage. Though it’s worth noting: history’s shown that once we start mining in a new area, we tend not to stop everywhere else. We just end up doing both."
John Oliver,"But setting aside the potential harm here, what’s the potential benefit? Because if these nodules really could provide unlimited energy for billions of people, I’d say maybe it is worth thinking about. But the truth is, they may not be as critical for our clean energy future as Barron insists. Because while it’s true the metals inside them are a key component of batteries now, “lithium-ion batteries are fast being replaced by new battery chemistries that don’t require cobalt or nickel.” And we’re even starting to see innovation like this:"
John Oliver,"Lithium batteries need precious minerals like cobalt and nickel to work, but sodium doesn’t. It’s found everywhere. It’s simply salt. The world’s largest battery manufacturer, Chinese CATL, already went big on sodium-ion technology in 2021. Just two years later, it was supplying Chinese carmaker Chery with salt batteries."
John Oliver,"It’s true, they’re starting to make car batteries out of salt! So move over, cocaine. You’re no longer the most valuable white powder in town! It’s also worth noting that many tech and car companies, including these, have already pledged not to use metals extracted from deep-sea mining until they understand the environmental impact, which, as you’ve seen, could be significant. Meanwhile, more and more countries are calling for a precautionary pause or moratorium on deep-sea mining. And I’d argue the U.S. should join them. Although our argument would have a lot more force if we finally ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty."
John Oliver,"And I’m far from the first person to say this. Lots of organizations want the U.S. to have a seat at the table, from environmental groups who want to use it to protect the ocean, to mining groups who want to use it to do the exact opposite of that. But pretty much everyone agrees we should sign it, to the point that, in 2012, there was a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “Time to Join the Law of the Sea Treaty,” written by five Secretaries of State including Henry Kissinger. Meaning Kissinger and I finally have one thing in common. Well, two things. That and our skin care routine. I’m assuming, given the results. But that really is it."
John Oliver,"Ultimately, it’s going to take us having the patience to wait for the science on this, and the discipline to actually listen to what it has to say. And I know that’s hard to do. Because it’s so much easier to pull out a rock and call it the savior of humanity. Watch, even I can do it. Mother Nature made these nodules and said come and get me! See? It’s easy, but that doesn’t make it true. Especially because this is actually a chocolate truffle. The point is: it’s beyond time that we stop treating the deep ocean as something to exploit, and start treating it for what it really is: a mind-blowingly vast, virtually unknown world within our world. One filled with beauty, wonder, and of course, unfuckable uggos I wouldn’t touch with an octopus dick."
John Oliver,"Moving on. Before we go, a quick update on Red Lobster . Last week, we talked about its recent bankruptcy filing, and revealed that we won an auction for the entire contents of this Red Lobster in Kingston, New York, which we then rebuilt in this studio, but only serving Cheddar Bay Biscuits. It was all in good fun, but it turns out, someone from Kingston wasn’t too thrilled about what we did."
John Oliver,"An Ulster County restaurant owner has beef with a popular HBO show host over Red Lobster. He says that John Oliver, host of “Last Week Tonight,” snatched up some equipment from a now-closed Red Lobster that the restaurant owner was trying to buy."
John Oliver,"Okay, let me stop you there. “Popular HBO host”? Oh, my God, stop! Stop it! Popular? Come on! Stop! But I’m sorry. You were saying?"
John Oliver,"The owner of Deising’s Bakery and Restaurant tells me that comedian John Oliver ate his lunch. Once Eric Deising heard a nearby Red Lobster was closing, he saw an opportunity to upgrade his business. He dropped off this note. “I need a 36-inch flat top oven/grill and a commercial kitchen convection oven if you have them.” If this Red Lobster did have the items Eric Deising was seeking, we know where they are now. I was looking for a piece of equipment. If you don’t need that, because I don’t think you need it for biscuits, let me know."
John Oliver,"Okay, first, with all due respect, if you wanted equipment from that Red Lobster, leaving a note on the door is a weird way to get it. The restaurant closed down. That’s like going to a cemetery and leaving a note on a tombstone that says, “Hey, can I have your socks?” Though I love that he’s watching our show the same way everyone else does: on a phone in the middle of a workday without even a hint of enjoyment on his face. But he wasn’t the only one annoyed with us. Apparently, that Red Lobster’s technically just outside Kingston, in Ulster, New York, and a spokesperson for their town supervisor told a reporter, “If he bought everything from the Kingston location, he has nothing, because the Red Lobster is in the town of Ulster."
John Oliver,"I sincerely apologize. Although, in my defense, I’m not the only one who thought that Red Lobster was in Kingston. You know who else did? Google Maps, Yelp, Facebook, Red Lobster’s own website, and even, by the way, the Ulster County tourism website. Still, I do apologize. I certainly wouldn’t want to take the great honor of having a closed-down Red Lobster away from you. And I will say the local news did generously point out that fights like this really are what we do best here."
John Oliver,Fighting with some zip code in Connecticut.
John Oliver,"He once started a fake fight with the entire city of Danbury, Connecticut, eventually leading the local sewage plant to be named after him. So what’s going to be the fallout from the Red Lobster segment?"
John Oliver,"Okay, first, that wasn’t a “fake fight”. That was the realest fight of my life. Also, I started that fight with Danbury in the middle of the pandemic. And it was a very weird time. Some of us got into cross-stitch, some got into “Animal Crossing.” And yes, some of us picked a fight with a Connecticut town, eventually showing up there wearing the hazmat suit from Contagion to dedicate a sewage plant in our memory. Though, it’s worth pointing out, during lockdown I also bought a rat erotica painting from 1992, sponsored a marble racing league, and sexually harassed Adam Driver for eight solid months. So, fighting with Danbury might’ve been the fourth weirdest thing I did during the pandemic."
John Oliver,"And to be honest, we were going to ignore this. But then we took a look at online reviews of that guy’s bakery, and honestly, it looks pretty good. They do lots of themed baked goods. For Groundhog Day, they sell these adorable little groundhog cakes. And for St. Patrick’s Day, they made these monstrosities, to which someone on Facebook asked the understandable question “What are these?” And I’ll tell you exactly what they are. That’s actually Saint Patrick. Most people don’t know this, but this is what he looked like back when he was a missionary in the 5th century. So that cake is an extremely accurate and faithful depiction of him."
John Oliver,"But my favorite review on Yelp says, “You like burgers? Great! You like onion rings and French fries? Great! You like pancakes? Great! You like cake bears? Great!” Along with this photo of a cake bear. And I’m sorry, but I don’t like cake bears. I fucking love cake bears. I want one right now, and you know what? I’m gonna eat it ass first. What else are you gonna do? What, are you gonna start from the head like a monster? Have some class! Also, respectfully, check out the donk on that cake bear. That cake’s got cakes. It’s draggin’ a wagon, and I want to hop on board."
John Oliver,"But look, Deising’s Bakery, I’ve got good news and bad news. The bad news is, we actually already donated the Red Lobster kitchen equipment. And even if we hadn’t, it didn’t have the “36 inch flattop oven/grill or kitchen convection oven” you were looking for. The good news is, we’re willing to buy those items for you on one condition. All I want in return is a baked good with my face on it on sale in your bakery. Specifically, a cake bear with my face on it. I want to be a cake bear. You don’t even have to give me as much ass as you gave that cake bear. I mean, it’d be nice considering we’re literally buying kitchen equipment for you and it’s clear you have the skill to do it. But you don’t have to. I trust your vision. As long as it fits the general description of “John Oliver cake bear,” I’ll be more than happy."
John Oliver,"So that’s my offer. And because I know the normal way of asking for things isn’t really your style, I’ve written this offer on a piece of paper like this, that’s currently taped to the door of your bakery. So what do you say? Please say yes! Please do say yes! We’ve already bought the equipment. It’s right here waiting to be delivered to you. And just look at this convection oven. It’s raring to do some convecting. All you have to do is simply start selling John Oliver cake bears, and all of this is yours. The bear is in your court, Deising’s Bakery. That is our show! Thank you so much for watching! We’ll see you next week. Good night! Make me a cake bear. I want to be a cake bear."
