John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 11 Episode 19 Aired on August 4, 2024"
John Oliver,"Welcome, welcome, welcome to “Last Week Tonight!” I’m John Oliver . Thank you so much for joining us. It has been a busy week! The White House completed a prisoner swap with Russia, Venezuela’s disputed election sparked protests across the country, and Donald Trump had a disastrous appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists, with maybe the low point being this:"
John Oliver,"I mean this in the most disparaging way possible: that went about as well as could be expected. Putting Trump in front of a Black audience and asking him to speak on race was never going to get more elevated than “the lady said she was both Indian and Black, that’s cheating.” Also—not that this needs saying—Harris didn’t “make a turn” into being Black like it’s an interstate offramp. Her father’s Black and her mother was Indian. I can’t imagine what J.D. Vance —a man with three biracial children—was thinking while watching Trump there. Although, you know what? He was probably thinking “mmmm. Look at that luscious upholstery. Do those cushions come all the way off?"
John Oliver,"But we’re going to turn to the Olympics. They’ve been going on all week, with some notable hiccups—from the Olympic flag being flown upside-down, to the South Korean delegation being introduced as the “Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” which is—fun fact—the wrong Korea, to the triathlon taking place in the Seine despite it previously failing multiple tests for pollution. Though that did give us this amazing bit of color commentary regarding U.S. triathlete Seth Rider ‘s preparations:"
John Oliver,"Wow. Turns out there is such a thing as “too much” Olympic backstory. Now, I should say—Rider’s since said he was kidding, which is good for multiple reasons, not least that not washing your hands isn’t how you microdose E. coli. The way you do that is by eating at Chipotle. Everyone knows that."
John Oliver,"But there’ve been some glorious moments, too—from Simone Biles ‘ triumphs, to this badass South Korean sharpshooter winning silver, to this guy who medaled while looking like he just happened to wander past the Olympics. He looks like he was called in for “one last job” and that job involved Microsoft Excel."
John Oliver,"Sadly, there were also some incredibly stupid controversies. There was a wildly transphobic uproar over this Algerian boxer supposedly being trans—despite the fact she isn’t. And there was even anger over the incredibly French opening ceremony, which featured a chorus of beheaded Marie Antoinettes, a torch relay across the rooftops of Paris, and a cancan along the Seine. The only way it could have been more French is if there’d been a ménage à trois between three people dressed in clown outfits and you know what? There was. There was a clown threesome."
John Oliver,"Although one element of the ceremony got some extra blowback—this scene, in which drag queens and other performers were gathered at a table. It was meant to evoke pagan feasts, but some saw something else in it, and were furious."
John Oliver,"You know, it’s always strange to watch Trump act like he cares about religion because, to echo something I heard someone say recently, “I didn’t know he was Christian until a number of years ago when he happened to turn Christian… All of a sudden he made a turn and became a Christian person.” Criticism of that scene also focused on this nearly-naked man, meant to evoke the Greek god Dionysus, although he mainly looked like a perverted Smurf crashing a wedding reception. He actually went on CNN to kind of apologize, then responded to a follow-up question with a quintessentially French answer."
John Oliver,"I love it. Every part of that is great—not just showing the reporter his blue belly button, but the way he introduces it by saying “there are still traces of the past.” [Speaking in a French accent] “Look, we are all ze product of our choices, our decisions. We are ze sum of what came before. Ze past, she does not wash out, no matter how hard you, how you say, scrub-a-dub."
John Oliver,"And look, there’ll clearly be more to say about the Olympics as they go on, but we’re going to dive straight in with our main story tonight: the 2024 election. It’s probably one of the last stories you want us to cover right now, below hippo hemorrhoids, but above “your parents’ sex life.” Long story short: they tried wheelbarrow, that’s how your dad hurt his hip."
John Oliver,"There’s obviously a lot of talk about these two candidates, but we’re going to focus on the person currently polling third: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Voters have learned a lot about RFK recently—from the fact his distinctive voice is caused by a condition called spasmodic dysphonia, to the news that doctors once found a dead worm in his brain, to even his physical fitness routine, which he’s put front and center in ads like this."
John Oliver,"Cool. To be honest, that looks less like a campaign ad and more like the dating profile of a guy who just lost custody. And while it’s a bit weird to be working out in jeans—from one jock to another, I get it. You gotta put in the time and work to get our kind of body. Around the gym I’m known as “John Oliver Esquire” because I always have permission to approach the bench. Is this HGTV? Because I’m all gains. Call me the third little pig, because I’m building. A brick. House."
John Oliver,"Kennedy’s campaign has really leaned into his quirkiness, offering supporters the chance to win things like “go whale watching with RFK, Jr. and his wife Cheryl Hines ” or “win a day of falconry with RFK, Jr.” featuring this image of him and a falcon that looks like they’re asking you to be their third. And he’s attracted a broad base of supporters, with polls finding there isn’t a single issue or topic that seems to unify RFK voters, who can be drawn to him for all sorts of reasons."
John Oliver,"Supporter 1 : He’s an honest candidate, he’s very truthful."
John Oliver,Supporter 2 : The Kennedys are really royalty in this country because they do the right thing. His family has always been into the rights for the underprivileged.
John Oliver,"Supporter 3 : He’s coming to all voters and saying that if you vote for me, like, you’ll be able to afford to buy a house."
John Oliver,"Supporter 4 : He’s anti-establishment without all the baggage. You know, he’s going to restore trust and transparency to our federal institutions because he’s a man of integrity. He has honor and he’s honest."
John Oliver,"Yeah, people like him for a bunch of reasons. Although, calling a Kennedy “anti-establishment” is a stretch. It’s like calling the Windsors “anti-hat.” That’s just not true. The Kennedys are the very definition of “the establishment,” and the Windsors are famously hat bitches. But the thing most people know about RFK is that he’s often called a conspiracy theorist. It’s a charge brought up so often, he was able to read off a list of insults in this ad."
John Oliver,"That’s pretty likeable! And kudos to Vanity Fair for not soft-pedaling it with “vile” or “divorced from reality” and instead going for the jugular with, “this guy’s vibe is so bad it was the low point of my summer.” That is, genuinely, so mean, and I couldn’t respect it more. But despite that, RFK’s currently polling around 6%—and in some crucial swing states, like Michigan, he could tip the balance—especially given, as of taping, Trump and Harris are neck and neck there, and RFK is polling close to 7%. And to quote absolutely no one from Hillary’s 2016 campaign: we should be worried about Michigan."
John Oliver,"So if he’s this popular, and has the potential to have this much influence, tonight, let’s talk about RFK Jr. And let’s start with the obvious. He’s, first and foremost, a Kennedy. His uncle, JFK , was the 35th President who, as history buffs may know, was assassinated in 1963. Five years later, his dad was also assassinated, when Kennedy was just 14 years old. In his later teens and twenties, he struggled with drug addiction, but in 1983, he got sober and soon became the chief prosecuting attorney for what would become the environmentalist group Riverkeeper, kicking off a career doing some genuinely laudable work—railing against fracking, Hudson River pollution, and greedy corporations poisoning natural resources. That’s why New York Magazine called him “the Kennedy who matters,” and Time named him a “hero for the planet."
John Oliver,"And as a candidate he’s tried to tap into the liberal credibility his work got back then. He’s promised to be “the greatest environmental president in American history,” and has talked about a bunch of things we’ve covered, like so-called “forever chemicals” or PFAS, and the proliferation of microplastics. You know, all the fun stuff you expect from our comedy show, which at this point should probably be called “You Have Already Been Poisoned,” with the Duolingo owl’s biological uncle."
John Oliver,"And it’s not just that—he’s also proposed raising the minimum wage to $15, and making student debt dischargeable via bankruptcy. And if I ended the piece right now, it’d honestly be a pretty good ad for RFK, Jr. But unfortunately, there is a lot more to say. And let’s start with his other policy proposals. Because some are, to put it mildly, underbaked. One of his marquee promises is offering first-time homebuyers a 3% mortgage rate, funded by tax-free government-issued bonds. Here he is describing the plan and see how far he gets into his pitch before you start hearing alarm bells."
John Oliver,"Right. He’s suggesting giving low-interest home loans to buyers with bad credit, guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie, an idea with no bad historical precedents whatsoever. And if you’re wondering, “Doesn’t that guy remember 2008?” I don’t know, but I should point out, they didn’t find the worm until 2010. So he might actually have an amazing excuse there. But “not fully thinking through” policies is just the beginning."
John Oliver,"Because you should know—RFK’s also a lot more right-wing on certain issues than you might assume. On immigration, he endorsed Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy, and pledged to finish the wall. And on Gaza, he’s repeatedly opposed a cease-fire deal, compared the war there to the denazification of Germany, and called Palestinians “arguably the most pampered people by international aid organizations in the history of the world.” And it seems you can say any stupid thing if you put the word “arguably” in front of it. Arguably, Boeing is having a great year. It isn’t, but you could argue it, and then lose the argument."
John Oliver,"And it’s not just policy where Kennedy might not be who you want him to be. He’s also admitted to flying on Epstein’s private jet, and, when asked about that on a podcast, gave an answer so honest, the host seemed to feel the need to try and rescue him."
John Oliver,"I mean, sure, but that’s still a “who’s who” of ’90s murderers and sex offenders there. And while there are lots of things you can shrug off with “that’s just New York,” I’m not sure this is one of them. Rats? That’s just New York. Dragging your clothing four blocks once a week? That’s just New York. One person in your subway car talking about Jesus and another doing flips and eventually the one doing flips accidentally kicks the one talking about Jesus? That’s just New York. But having a Rolodex that turns out to be part sex-offender registry? That’s a you problem, Bobby, leave the rest of us out of it."
John Oliver,"And in other personal stories, he comes off even worse. Just last month, a Vanity Fair article revealed that a former babysitter had accused him of sexual assault. And that’s something you’d expect he’d have a strong denial for, but instead, what you get is this."
John Oliver,"Okay, I’m sorry, first “not a church boy?” If the implication is “people affiliated with the church don’t commit sexual assault,” boy do I have bad news for you and your massive Catholic family. Also, “rambunctious youth” is a terrible way to respond to allegations you assaulted a babysitter, no matter what, but especially considering the alleged assault took place when you were 40 years old. And on top of all that, when he was asked whether more women might be coming forward, Bill O’Reilly felt the need to step in."
John Oliver,"O’Reilly : And look, let’s see what happens. And the only worse way he could follow that up is with “Bill Cosby’s been to my house."
John Oliver,"But obviously, the biggest issue with RFK is his reputation as a conspiracy theorist and anti-vaxxer. And if you support him, you may think that’s been overblown. You might think, “he went on a podcast I listen to, and he seemed totally reasonable.” And he does do a lot of them. We listened to a bunch, and in doing so, noticed an interesting pattern: on the more mainstream ones, he’ll go out of his way to seem reasonable and open-minded in fact, he’s got a line he likes to deploy a lot, in podcasts and other settings."
John Oliver,"That sounds pretty good! Even if “show me a fact” sounds like what a John Oliver action figure would say when you pull the string on his back. That and “it’s not sexual harassment if it’s a horse.” Unfortunately, history has shown him to be much more dug-in than he likes to imply. And before we get to his more famous views on vaccines and COVID, you should know they’re by no means his only alarming stances. Take AIDS. It is a scientifically proven fact that AIDS is caused by HIV. But in the early ’80s, people looked at the fact it was spreading in the U.S. and Europe largely within the gay community, and tried to locate other factors that might be causing it. Nowadays, most people accept those early theories were dead ends, but amazingly, as recently as three years ago RFK was out there saying shit like this."
John Oliver,"Okay, there’s a lot there, from “a gay lifestyle” to repeating the claim that “people were dying mainly because of poppers,” to the notion that poppers caused Kaposi sarcoma, which—for the record—they do not. Multiple studies in humans have found that even heavy popper use showed no significant association with the risk of Kaposi sarcoma. Which does makes sense, given that poppers are still sold everywhere in this city. I got these three blocks from here, as I do before every taping of this show. How else do you think I get through this shit?"
John Oliver,"But it didn’t stop there. Kennedy’s also argued that Anthony Fauci — who at the time worked within the NIH—and other experts wanted to call HIV a virus partly so his agency, and the pharmaceutical industry, could profit from the production of AZT, which was the first drug approved by the FDA to treat HIV and AIDS. That’s part of a series of arguments known as “AIDS denialism,” which has done real damage. One of its biggest proponents, a scientist named Peter Duesberg , actually helped persuade the South African government to forego supplying AZT to those with AIDS—a decision that’s been estimated to have cost over 330,000 lives there. Yet RFK recently wrote that Duesberg’s arguments were “so clean, so elegantly crafted and so compelling.” And “elegantly crafted?” That’d be annoying if you were writing copy on the back of a $12 chocolate bar, but in this instance, it’s just obscene."
John Oliver,"And it’s not just AIDS where Kennedy’s made big eye-catching claims that bear no resemblance to reality. Here he is last year, in a “Twitter Spaces” chat with Elon Musk , suggesting that psychiatric drugs may be a cause of school shootings."
John Oliver,"Okay. So before we go any further, let me just say—I also don’t want to be doing this. I don’t want to be debunking his arguments at length. I’m so close to taking a hit of these poppers, you have no idea. But he’s made so many confident assertions there, and if you leave even one unchallenged, people will think, “well, maybe there’s something to it.” So with that in mind. First: Prozac hit the market in 1988, and as you probably already know: there were tons of shootings and mass shootings before then, including at schools. As for the claim “other countries have as many guns as we do,” they just don’t. US civilians have the highest rate of gun ownership in the world by a factor of more than two. And as for linking school shootings to “the amount of psychiatric drugs our children are taking,” researchers haven’t found any link between antidepressants and school shootings. In fact, one study found that over 87% of the secondary school shooters it sampled were not on psychiatric medications at the time of their attacks."
John Oliver,"So multiple facts there are just plain wrong, despite how confidently he just spewed them out there. He could just as easily have pointed out the link between school shooters and milk. Because you know what? A shocking number have above-average dairy intake. And ice cream, in particular, may contain neuroglycerides that initiate psychopathic behavior. Except none of that’s true, I just made all that shit up. Neuroglycerides isn’t even a word. And Lactose Quarterly isn’t a magazine. But it shows just how easy it is to reel people in when you’re spouting self-assured bullshit on an unchallenged platform."
John Oliver,"And if you’re noticing a pattern here—that RFK will find a problem, and then work backwards to point at a big, powerful entity pulling the strings—that’s basically what he’s done with vaccines. Although, again: he’ll deny that, insisting he’s not anti-vax at all. Here he is making that point, under oath, before Congress."
John Oliver,"Yeah, that’s a pretty vehement denial. And, quick shout out to the guy recording that like it’s his kid’s dance recital. When are you gonna watch this thing, dude? You do know there are other cameras recording this, right? But here’s the thing—remember when I said Kennedy goes on a lot of podcasts, and can sound reasonable? He goes on a bunch of fringey ones, too. And when addressing those audiences, sends out a very different message—like on this one, three years ago."
John Oliver,"I love that. I love it.” I have to say: that’s exactly the kind of person I’d expect to be co-hosting an anti-vaccine podcast. The sort of person you’d expect to see walking around a grocery store during a COVID surge, licking everything to “fortify her immune system.” But I only say that because she actually did that, and posted it to Instagram, because of course she did."
John Oliver,"But also, you don’t get to say “I’m not anti-vax” and then wander around the woods telling people to not vaccinate their babies like you’re some red-pilled version of Smokey the Bear. Who I’m realizing is clearly where you get your workout wardrobe inspiration from. Over the years, Kennedy’s promoted a number of theories about vaccines, including how they supposedly cause autism. We’ve discussed his claim that a preservative called thimerosal was linked to autism in our piece on vaccines several years ago. Not only is it bullshit, thimerosal hasn’t been in children’s vaccines since 2001, except for the flu vaccine, and even then, there was, and remains, a version without thimerosal in it."
John Oliver,"But Kennedy parlayed the initial panic he helped cause into founding the Children’s Health Defense, one of the country’s leading anti-vaccine organizations. And he’s continued to fearmonger about a connection between thimerosal and autism ever since. In 2015, he said of kids getting vaccinated, “they get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone… This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.” Which is clearly absurd. A vaccine can’t make someone’s brain go away, although I’m increasingly believing that a dead worm might be able to."
John Oliver,"And if you’re noticing a certain cruelty in how Kennedy tends to talk about autistic people, you’re not wrong. It goes well beyond the anti-vax community’s general gross tendency to imply they’d rather have a kid die from polio or measles than be diagnosed with autism. Just listen to him here."
John Oliver,"Okay, first, if there’s limited variety in the people you’ve met your age, maybe it’s because you only ever hung out with the same circle of five or six sex offenders or murderers, I don’t know. I’m just asking questions. And I could talk about the history of autism diagnoses, and how they’re still so new, the first person to be given one died just last year. I could talk about autistic people were long misunderstood and institutionalized. I could also throw in that there’s definitely no such diagnosis as “full-blown autism.” Or you know what? I could just let this guy with autism point out that just because RFK didn’t know anyone with autism, didn’t mean they didn’t exist, in the most deliciously derisive way."
John Oliver,"Yeah. I honestly can’t put it much better than that. And look, RFK will insist he just wants vaccines to be tested for safety and efficacy, but as we’ve said before: they have been, and repeatedly. Not only are vaccines already held to a higher safety standard than other medications—thousands of studies have found they’re safe and effective. Including a systematic review of over 160 studies on vaccine safety that found any serious adverse reactions were “extremely rare.” You could also look at this study of over 650,000 children born in Denmark—some vaccinated, some not—which concludes that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, or this meta-review of 10 studies involving over 1.25 million children, which also revealed no relationship between vaccination and autism."
John Oliver,"There are so many examples like this, and it’s why experts will tell you that a person’s chance of having a bad reaction to a vaccine is about one in a million. As one expert we spoke to pointed out, given we have over 40,000 deaths by car accident in the U.S. per year, the most dangerous aspect of vaccinating children is driving to the doctor’s office to get them. Especially, by the way, if the kids are singing “Baby Shark” the whole time. Because that will make you drive off a cliff."
John Oliver,"And I know this can all seem very abstract. But the thing is, Kennedy’s ideas have been put to the test in the real world, sometimes with hideous consequences. Take what happened in Samoa. In 2018, there was a horrible accident, when two children died from a measles vaccine that two nurses had incorrectly mixed with a muscle relaxant. It was awful, but it was human error. Nevertheless, the anti-vax movement seized on the sudden fear of vaccines there, and the following year, Kennedy visited Samoa, in a trip arranged by a local anti-vaccine influencer. There, he met with other anti-vaccine activists, including one who wrote that the meeting was “profoundly monumental … For this movement.” He even met with the prime minister, with whom he discussed vaccines, in his words, “a limited amount.” And when, a few months later, there was a measles outbreak in Samoa, RFK wrote a four-page letter to the prime minister in which he suggested the measles vaccine itself might be the true cause of the crisis."
John Oliver,"In the end, that outbreak killed 83 people, mostly infants and children, in large part due to their lack of vaccinations—an outbreak Kennedy later referred to as “mild.” And when confronted about all this, he’s quick to try and distance himself."
John Oliver,"Got it! So you just popped in to one of the most remote countries on earth, and just happened to encounter all your antivax buddies along the way. It’s the ultimate conspiracist code: “nothing is a coincidence except when I do it.” And look, on some level, I do get why people are drawn to RFK. There’s an earned distrust of big pharma, and medical authorities. And illness and disease are scary. Kennedy’s explanations—as bullshit as they may be—can almost be comforting at a frightening time. That’s an environment in which he thrives. And it may explain why his popularity took off during the COVID pandemic. There was a lot of uncertainty back then, and medical experts were understandably making mistakes and learning in real time. Kennedy saw that, and pounced."
John Oliver,"He took a lot of big swings, including writing a book in which he claimed Fauci was using COVID to execute a historic coup d’etat against Western democracy. And once again, his “just asking questions” caused real harm to real people. For example: he pushed the idea that the COVID vaccine was dangerous, especially to young people—even writing the foreword to this book called Cause Unknown: The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 & 2022, a compilation of young people who’d died suddenly, heavily implying their deaths were caused by the vaccine."
John Oliver,"And look, it’s true that a very few young people reported heart complications after receiving the vaccine, but not only is the risk rare, and most patients felt better quickly, but importantly, in children and teens, the risks of getting COVID and developing severe illness that could seriously impact the heart are far greater than the risk of developing post-vaccine heart complications. Nevertheless, in that book’s foreword, RFK wrote that it proves an undeniable and urgent reality, laid out with facts that can be confirmed by any reader, point by point, page by page. He even went on Joe Rogan to give the book a hard sell."
John Oliver,"Okay, set aside that Joe Rogan’s just muttering random words off the cover with an energy level I’d describe as “just ate a fistful of melatonin pills,” that’s a pretty hard sell from RFK: give this book to people for 90 minutes and they’ll be converted. But here’s the thing. The AP found that dozens of individuals included in the book died of known causes not related to vaccines—including suicide and choking while intoxicated. The book even includes one person who died in 2019. So unless the headline was, “Time Traveler Dies of COVID Vaccine,” they don’t really belong in there."
John Oliver,"But that’s not all. Because when the book was first printed, one of the kids on the cover was Braden Fahey , who died after collapsing during football practice at just 12 years old. But we know for a fact that the COVID vaccine didn’t kill Braden, because he wasn’t vaccinated. He died from a malformed blood vessel in his brain. And no one ever contacted his parents to ask about their son’s death, or for permission to use his photo. Something they are, understandably, furious about."
John Oliver,"Braden’s Father : It’s just another gut punch. You know, we’ve been punched in the gut as hard as you can be punched in the gut. And this is just another one right after, you know. You try so hard to each day to heal. And then you just have to take on a whole other nightmare. And part of you wants to just dismiss it and go, “we’ve dealt with so much, we can’t deal with any more.” But then, you know, you just have to do it for your son and we can’t as his parents look the other way."
John Oliver,"That’s awful. They’ve had to go out of their way to correct the record about their son’s death, in the face of someone who not only has the platform of a Kennedy but also of a presidential candidate. Now I should tell you: after that story, Braden was removed from the cover of subsequent editions of that book. But not only is the publisher still selling the first version, with him on the cover, on Amazon, even the newer edition despite everything we just told you—still includes him inside the book itself. And the publisher’s excuse for this is enraging, because they argued to us this week that the book never specifically says that the people shown in it died from the COVID vaccine, just that it highlights “a new trend of people dying suddenly for unknown causes."
John Oliver,"Which is not what the book does, at all. And it’s definitely not what RFK did when he tweeted out its cover, with Braden’s picture on it, and claimed the book showed “the COVID shots are a crime against humanity.” That tweet is still up, which is a little odd to me, because—what was it Kennedy liked to say?"
John Oliver,"Huh. That’s weird. But I guess it makes sense. Saying, “If somebody shows me a fact and I’m wrong, I’m going to totally ignore it and force grieving parents to relive the worst thing that’s ever happened to them” doesn’t quite have the same ring to it, does it? And look, I could litigate Kennedy’s stupid arguments all night, but I really don’t want to do that to myself, or to you. There aren’t enough poppers in the world to take the edge off all this, and to quote his neurologist, “I really don’t have time to go down all these wormholes."
John Oliver,"Hopefully, though, at this point, you’ve got a better sense of who this man actually is. And if you didn’t know any of this, I do get why you might like him. Because the idea of RFK is appealing. But so many of the reasons to support him, just don’t stand up under the slightest scrutiny. If you’re voting for him because he seems honest, or trustworthy, I think you’ve seen otherwise. If it’s the Kennedy legacy, you should know over a dozen members of his family have come out against his campaign. If you’re voting for the environmental hero of the 90s, I’ll point out: multiple prominent environmental groups have opposed his campaign, including many former colleagues. If you like that he’s against polluters and big pharma, I get it. We criticize them all the time. But when we do that, we make sure we’ve got our facts right and don’t just pull them out the ass of our best workout jeans."
John Oliver,"And finally, if you’re frustrated with the two-party system—me, too. But honestly, the way to dismantle that isn’t through voting for one magical candidate, it’ll come from building a movement toward ranked-choice voting. And it’s important to know: at least one of those parties may not be as opposed to Kennedy, as he says he is to them. Because Republicans seem to be counting on him to siphon off Democratic votes. His campaign’s largest contributor is Timothy Mellon , a Republican megadonor who has also donated $50 million to a pro-Trump group this election. And if Trump wins a second term, Kennedy may wind up working for him. Because when we reached out to RFK’s campaign this week, they told us he and Trump have discussed the possibility of a cabinet position for him, specifically Health and Human Services. And if that’s true, that’s a fucking nightmare. There’s no good outcome here. Even if RFK drops out tomorrow, he’ll have injected and amplified misinformation that, as you’ve seen, takes a lot of effort to debunk. And if he stays in, history has shown spoiler candidates can do intense damage to no real end. And don’t just take that from me— Ralph Nader , famously, helped swing the election for George W. Bush back in 2000. And there was a guy back then, smartly imploring him to drop out."
John Oliver,"Right. Exactly. This is the only time I’m going to say this, but RFK is—and don’t you dare take this out of fucking context—making a really good point there. But the fact is, the rest of the time, Kennedy’s a full-blown menace, and frankly spending this much time thinking about him has been—if I may quote Vanity Fair —the low point of my summer. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ve earned these."
John Oliver,Reporter 1 : How you feel about cheesecake? It’s one of my favorite desserts. Today’s your day because today’s National Cheesecake Day.
John Oliver,Reporter 2 : Give me a New York-style cheesecake and it’s going to be 15 pounds back on me again. I’ll be celebrating today for sure. Today’s National Cheesecake Day. I’m not a fan of cheesecake. I don’t like cheesecake.
John Oliver,Reporter 3 : Wow. You don’t like cheesecake?
John Oliver,"Reporter 4 : I don’t, there’s just something about it that doesn’t make sense in my brain. I don’t know if it’s the flavor or the texture. Both. It’s just so—what’s your favorite cheesecake?"
John Oliver,Reporter 3 : I’m not a cheese guy. It’s just the idea of it.
John Oliver,"That’s our show, thank you so much for watching. We will see you next week. Good night!"
Main Segment,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his 2024 presidential campaign Other segments: Trump at the 2024 National Association of Black Journalists Convention and Career Fair, controversies at the 2024 Summer Olympics"
Reporter,Do you believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is only on the ticket because she is a Black woman?
Reporter,Were you able to wash all the blue paint off after the performance?
Trump,"I can say no, I think it’s maybe a little bit different. She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black. Now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know. Is she Indian, or is she Black? She was Indian all the way, then all of a sudden she made a turn and became a Black person."
Trump,"I thought that the opening ceremony was a disgrace, actually. I thought it was a disgrace. The mocking of the Last Supper? Catholics and Christians across—I thought—across the globe are outraged. I mean, they can do certain things, I thought it was… terrible."
Commentator,"He prepared himself for what he would face here by essentially microdosing E. coli. He said that he was trying to get his body used to it in small doses. And he would do things leading up to these games, like not washing his hands after he would go to the bathroom. Stuff like that."

Rfk Jr,I go to the gym every day. I hike every day. I don’t ever eat processed food. I do intermittent fast.
Rfk Jr,"He’s a walking, talking conspiracy theory,” The New York Times . “He’s completely divorced from reality,” The Guardian . “He is vile,” The White House. “Being with him was a low point of my summer,” Vanity Fair . “He has conversations with dead people,” The Guardian . I wouldn’t vote for that guy either."
Rfk Jr,"If you have a rich uncle, um, who will co-sign your mortgage, you can get a much better rate. I’m going to give everybody a rich uncle, all these young people, which is Uncle Sam. Which is going to guarantee your mortgage. So that’ll allow you to get that 3% rate. And if you default on it, you know, we will inherit—the federal government will inherit—this is how Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae operated."
Rfk Jr,"You know, first of all, you know I’m in New York for most of my life. So, and you run into everybody in New York. I mean, I knew Harvey Weinstein , I knew Roger Ailes , I knew— O.J. Simpson came to my house. Bill Cosby came to my house."
Rfk Jr,"I did know a lot of them, but you don’t know these people are swamp creatures until all this stuff comes out."
Rfk Jr,"Listen, I’ve said this from the beginning. I am not a church boy. I am not running like that. I said in my… I had a very, very rambunctious youth. I said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world."
Rfk Jr,"I have a critical mind. If somebody shows me where I got it wrong, I’ll change. I’m not dug in. I’m not hardheaded in that sense. I will change my mind always if—if somebody confronts me with facts. If somebody shows me a fact and I’m wrong, I’m going to change my opinion and I’ll apologize."
Rfk Jr,"There’s a lot of people that said it’s not a virus, the virus is a—a passenger virus, and these people are dying mainly because of poppers. 100% Of the people who died in the first—of the first thousand who had—who had AIDS were people who were addicted to poppers which are known to cause Kaposi sarcoma in rats. And—you know, they were people were part of a gay lifestyle that—where they were burning the candle at both ends."
Rfk Jr,"Prior to the introduction of Prozac, we had almost no—none of these events in our country. And we never seen them in human history, where people walk into a school room of children or strangers and start shooting people. There’s other nations that have as many guns per capita as we do. Switzerland, the last school shooting was 21 years ago. We have one every 21 hours. The one thing that we have that’s different than anybody in the world is the amount of psychiatric drugs our children are taking and our people are taking and we need to look at that."
Rfk Jr,"I have never been anti-vax. I have never told anybody—I have never told the public avoid vaccination. The only thing I’ve asked for, and my views are constantly misrepresented, so that the truth of what I believe is not allowed to have a conversation with—about the American people, which I believe vaccines should be tested with the same rigor as other medicines and medications."
Rfk Jr,"Our job is to resist and to talk about it with everybody. I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to them, don’t get them vaccinated. He heard that from me. If he hears it from 10 other people, maybe he won’t do it. You know, maybe he will—maybe he will save that child. When they hear that from 10 people, it’ll make an impression on ’em. You know, and if we all kept our mouths shut, don’t keep your mouth shut anymore. Confront everybody on it."
Rfk Jr,"I bet you’ve never met anybody with full-blown autism your age. You know, headbanging, football or a helmet on, non-toilet trained, nonverbal.

Rfk Jr,"Yeah, I’m aware there was a measles outbreak but I didn’t have anything, you know, I have nothing to do with people not vaccinating in Samoa. I never told anybody not to vaccinate. I didn’t, you know, go there for any reason to do with that."
Rfk Jr,"It’s the kind of book—if you have a skeptic and you can get them to sit down for 90 minutes with this book when they get up they will uh they will have converted. Mmmm. And it’s really, it’s sickening. I mean, it’s terrible. These, you know, these beautiful children who were dying on the playing field. And COVID was killing people, but it was old people. Cause Unknown, The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 and 2022. Edward Dowd. Yeah. Died after first vaccine dose. Dies at hospital. Football. Died on the field."
Rfk Jr,"If somebody shows me a fact and I’m wrong, I’m going to change my opinion and I’ll apologize."

Man,"Fucking Mount Everest wasn’t discovered until 1852 but I’m pretty sure it was still there. Also, yeah like all those fucking old grandpas with like a giant ass train collection, you don’t think they’re just a little bit on the spectrum? Just a teeny weeny?
