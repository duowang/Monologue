John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 11 Episode 27 Aired on October 27, 2024"
John Oliver,"John Oliver discusses Donald Trump’s plans to carry out mass deportations if reelected in November, and outlines some suggestions regarding one patriotic anthem."
John Oliver,"Welcome, welcome, welcome to Last Week Tonight ! I’m John Oliver . Thanks for joining us. It has been a busy week! Israel attacked military targets in Iran, and an E. coli outbreak was tied to McDonald’s, yet was still somehow the second most revolting thing inside one this week. But with the election just nine days away, we’re going to do something a bit different tonight and cover two main stories, both related to immigration."
John Oliver,"The subject of the Statue of Liberty’s famous inscription: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” which I believe replaced the original: “Come in bitches, let’s get twisted,” after it was deemed “simply too good."
John Oliver,"In the final campaign stretch, Trump’s focused relentlessly on immigration, and it has gotten ugly."
John Oliver,"They’re coming from 181 countries as of yesterday, right? And we’re a dumping ground. We’re like a… we’re like a garbage can for the world."
John Oliver,"These are stone-cold killers. They’ll walk into your kitchen, they’ll cut your throat."
John Oliver,"I don’t know if you’d call them people. In some cases, they’re not people, in my opinion, but I’m not allowed to say that, because the radical left says that’s a terrible thing to say."
John Oliver,"They’re destroying the blood of our country. That’s what they’re doing. They’re destroying our country. They don’t like it when I said that, and I never read Mein Kampf. They said, “Oh, Hitler said that in a much different way."
John Oliver,"Okay, for a start, immigrants aren’t destroying the blood of our country. If anything, Mountain Dew Baja Blast is doing that, and let me be the first to say I, for one, welcome the poison. But it is wild that Trump’s response to being told he’s quoting Hitler is, “No, he said it differently.” Especially because not that differently. Hitler wrote: “All great cultures of the past perished only because the original creative race died out from blood poisoning.” So, same general idea, just a bit more coherent."
John Oliver,"I guess what I’m saying is, when it comes to rhetoric, Trump’s no Hitler. But… let him cook?"
John Oliver,But it’s more than just talk about immigrants—Trump’s also made a very specific promise.
John Oliver,"As soon as I take the oath of office, we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower many years ago. He was a big deportation person."
John Oliver,"Okay, first, it’s a hell of a thing to be citing Eisenhower, given his program—which deported hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants—is widely seen as both a fiasco and a stain on U.S. history, while also having a name I’m literally unwilling to say on TV. It’s one of many facts you may not have known about Eisenhower, along with “He was the first president to ride in a helicopter, and the first to pose for an official photo like he’s on the cover of Women’s Health Magazine under the headline: ‘How to Feel Fabulous at Any Age!’"
John Oliver,"Mass deportation is a cornerstone pledge for the Trump campaign. It was promoted on signs at the Republican convention and is referenced in the party’s platform. And it seems to have widespread backing, given one survey found it has at least some support from 54% of Americans and 86% of Republicans. And Trump supporters will tell you they love the idea of mass deportation, even if they haven’t thought much about the details."
John Oliver,"Those people that are breaking the laws of this country, that came across here illegal, are going to be mass deported."
John Oliver,Mass deportations—that’s what Trump’s calling for.
John Oliver,"That’s millions of people. Well, the people that are here illegally, I don’t have any problem with people coming here. My grandparents came here, but they did it the right way. Millions of people, though. I don’t care. I think it has to happen. I think citizens have to be behind it. How do you think it’s possible to do that humanely? I don’t know that, but I’m confident Trump can do it."
John Oliver,"Are you? Look, there are things I’m confident Trump can and will do: paraphrase Hitler, emotionally abuse his children, eventually die on the toilet. But unlike Aunt Bedazzlehat here, I don’t think “figuring out how to humanely deport millions of people” is one of them."
John Oliver,"The fact is, a lot of people seem to be supporting something right now whose implications they may not fully understand. So given that, tonight, let’s talk about Trump’s mass deportation plan. And before we go any further, we’ll be talking a lot about the logistics of mass deportation , but for the record: the morality of it is despicable. Immigrants are human beings, no matter what McDonald’s worst employee says."
John Oliver,"With that said, let’s start with the sheer size of what Trump’s proposing. Because his campaign claims there are 20 to 25 million “illegal aliens” in the country—despite experts saying it’s roughly half that, with one group placing the number around 13 million people. So they’re already off by the “population of Ohio.” But that still leaves the task of removing 13 million people—many of whom, incidentally, are spread throughout the country and have lived here for decades."
John Oliver,"Also, deporting someone isn’t as simple as finding them, not liking their paperwork, and putting them on a plane. It usually requires an arrest, detention, legal processing, and only then, removal. And to carry out over 13 million arrests in a short period of time, it’s been estimated the government would need to hire between 220,000 and 409,000 new government employees and law enforcement officers."
John Oliver,"As for the detention part, think for a second what it would entail to detain 13 million people. Bear in mind, the most recent data has the entire U.S. prison and jail population at around 1.9 million. And we have a lot of prisons and jails in this country. They’re kind of our thing. If we had a slogan it should probably be America: Home of Jails and the KFC Double Down."
John Oliver,"And the Trump campaign will sometimes pretend they’ve taken this into consideration—here’s JD Vance , gaming out a possible approach."
John Oliver,"Now you’ve got 20 million, 25 million people. You have to figure out what to do with them. And I guess the way that I think about it, Bill, is, you know, it’s kind of like being asked, well, you have a sandwich and it’s 10 times the size of your mouth. How do you actually eat the whole thing? And you take it one bite at a time, right? And I think you start with the million most violent, most criminal illegal alien element. There’s probably, of the 20 million, there’s probably a million who’ve committed some violent crime. That’s an estimate. But I think it’s pretty close to the truth. You deport them first and you focus on them first."
John Oliver,"Okay, first—and I know this isn’t the point—I didn’t know Bill O’Reilly still had a show. I had the vague, uninterrogated sense that he died when Roger Ailes did, either because I thought they were the same person or because that seems like a plausible murder-suicide. I don’t know; the subconscious is hard to pin down."
John Oliver,"But second, “one bite at a time” is an incredibly callous way to refer to mass deportation, even before you get to his casual “one million of them are probably violent criminals,” a statistic sourced to “that’s an estimate, but I think it’s pretty close to the truth.” And for the record, to deport just a million people a year would still cost an estimated $88 billion annually, with the majority of that going toward building detention camps. Over a decade, that’d cost nearly $1 trillion."
John Oliver,"And to be clear, my biggest problem with “We’d spend nearly $1 trillion on detention camps for immigrants” is not the trillion-dollar part. I don’t want to see a headline tomorrow that says “John Oliver Blasts Detention Camps as Too Expensive.” But I do think it’s worth recognizing the extent to which Trump and Vance are full of shit from a practical standpoint as well as a moral one."
John Oliver,"But just for the sake of argument, let’s say mass deportation were a realistic policy. It still wouldn’t solve the problems the Trump campaign’s claiming it would. In fact, it’d make them worse. Because they’re constantly claiming deportations are the solution to unemployment, housing prices, and crime."
John Oliver,"So let’s take each in turn, starting with jobs . Historically, deportation has actually increased unemployment in this country. A study of the Obama years found that “when 500,000 undocumented immigrant workers were forced out of the country, 44,000 fewer jobs were held by U.S.-born workers.” Which may seem counterintuitive. But what’s often happened is, companies that rely on immigrants for their customer base or their workforce end up shutting down. And as immigrants themselves will tell you — they might be the only ones willing to do certain work."
John Oliver,"The thing is, if he wins, he kicks out all the immigrants. Those who work here in construction and everything, they’re immigrants. You’re not going to see a gringo filling his feet with cement or carrying bricks or carrying this or cleaning. You’re not going to see it."
John Oliver,"That’s blunt, but true. There are certain jobs and whole industries reliant on immigrant labor. In our piece on farmworkers, we showed you a viral video of a farmer explaining he couldn’t hire enough people to harvest his fields, so the produce was rotting. In that particular case, it was asparagus, so it was a minor tragedy at best. But the broader point stands. Removing 13 million people — who spend money in their communities — would badly hurt the economy. In fact, experts have said mass deportation would lead to a loss of somewhere between 4% and 7% of annual GDP, which would be a crash on par with the Great Recession. And I’m not an economist, despite looking like I was left on the doorstep of an auditor’s office as a baby, but my understanding is that the Great Recession was bad."
John Oliver,So that’s unemployment. What about housing ? Because the Trump campaign is promising mass deportation will also fix our housing crisis.
John Oliver,"This is simple supply and demand, my friends. We’ve got to do two things to lower the price of housing. Two things to lower the price of housing for Nevadans is we’ve got to build more houses, and we’ve got to deport the illegal aliens so that American homes go to American citizens."
John Oliver,"Okay, even if that wasn’t total bullshit, JD Vance ’s very existence is proof that supply and demand doesn’t always work. There was no demand for a business-pilled bearded sycophant that gets routinely ignored by Trump — we already have two of those, and we barely even use them. And yet, here we are with an unnecessary third."
John Oliver,"The fact is, many economists think large-scale deportations could actually backfire and make the housing crisis worse since — as you just saw pointed out — undocumented migrants are a key part of the construction industry, and “nationally, mass deportation would remove 1.5 million workers from the construction workforce,” including more than one in three roofers, ceiling tilers, stucco masons, plasterers, and drywall installers. In fact, one professor who studies immigration says that, in the long run, immigrants are the solution to the housing crisis. Without immigrants, you can’t increase the supply of housing. And for what it’s worth, J.D. Vance , that’s supply and demand in action. I’m guessing you’ll solve poverty by comparing it to a turkey fucking rubin."
John Oliver,"And finally, there’s the claim that mass deportation will reduce violent crime . As we’ve discussed before, for all the coverage isolated incidents get, research shows immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born people, and FBI data shows violent crime has actually gone down since 2020. It’s one of the genuinely good decreases since then, along with the amount of Zoom family dinners and the number of alive Henry Kissingers . One was still one too many."
John Oliver,"But despite that, Trump’s continued making lurid accusations. There were his bullshit claims of pet-eating in Springfield, Ohio, but he’s also falsely claimed Aurora, Colorado, is the victim of a Venezuelan gang takeover. It’s an accusation that originated with this viral video of men with guns, knocking on an apartment door. That clip frightened a lot of people, but to be clear—the Republican mayor of Aurora has flat-out said, “A Venezuelan gang is not in control of those apartment complexes,” and the city has not been taken over or invaded or occupied by migrant gangs."
John Oliver,"But none of that stopped Trump from going to Aurora to push for mass deportation, with the help of Stephen Miller , who even brought along some visual aids."
John Oliver,"Look at all these photos around me. Are these the kids you grew up with? Are these the neighbors you were raised with? Are these the neighbors that you want in your city? No! No. These are the criminal migrants that Kamala Harris brought into your community. And as swiftly as they came, Donald Trump will send them back."
John Oliver,"Okay, for the record, if we’re talking about someone you don’t want as your neighbor? Stephen Miller would be top of my list. Imagine getting up in the morning, looking across your yard, and seeing that fucking guy standing there, looking like a minion’s penis."
John Oliver,"Also, quick side note: if you’re wondering what this thing is? It’s a fair question, and that’s a Trumpy Bear . A stuffed bear with Trump’s hair, a tie, and disturbingly human eyes. It looks like Paddington Bear if he had multiple hemorrhoids. It looks like a Care Bear that won’t stop calling the other Care Bears gay."
John Oliver,"But don’t let that bear distract you from the fact you just saw a crowd baited into booing pictures of Hispanic people who “don’t look like your neighbors.” At that event, Trump announced plans for something he calls “Operation Aurora,” and his campaign has since described the city as “a war zone.” And that specific language points to what his real end game here might look like."
John Oliver,"Because while—again—Trump can’t deport 13 million, or even 1 million, people overnight, and mass deportation won’t fix any of the problems he says it will, he could still use Aurora-style panics to give himself a ton of power. Here he is, at that rally, gaming out a key piece of it."
John Oliver,"I will invoke the Aliens Enemy Act of 1798. Think of that. 1798. This was put there in 1798. That is a long time ago, right? To target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil."
John Oliver,"Okay, 1798 is “a long time ago,” I reluctantly concede that point. But the act he’s describing there is terrifying. It’s a law that allows for summary deportation of people from countries with which the United States is at war, that have invaded the U.S., or that have engaged in “predatory incursions.” It was last used during World War II as the legal authority for interning immigrants of Japanese, German, and Italian descent."
John Oliver,"And experts are concerned that a president like Trump could recognize a cartel as the government of Mexican territory, then proclaim a migrant “invasion” perpetrated by the cartel “government,” and in doing so give himself a turbocharged deportation authority. That way, he could quickly remove non-citizens—even green card holders—without any due process."
John Oliver,"And while there’d be legal challenges, the courts are now much more Trump-friendly than they were eight years ago. And even if Trump doesn’t choose to go that far or does get stopped by the courts, it’s worth remembering what he was able to do in his first term anyway. Because in addition to the endless circus of outrageous nonsense back then—like hosting a fast-food banquet, or staring directly into the sun, or doing a loud honk honk in a big vroom vroom—he also aggressively ramped up immigration enforcement, using large-scale “worksite raids,” which involved immigration agents storming workplaces."
John Oliver,"That’s what happened in 2019 when ICE carried out massive raids on chicken processing plants across central Mississippi, arresting 680 workers in what may have been the largest-ever workplace operation in any single state. And these weren’t sweeps for “violent criminals.” They were attacks on working people whose only offense was being undocumented. More than 350 were deported, and many others are still awaiting court decisions. Many of the families broken up that day remain separated half a decade later."
John Oliver,"And the trauma of those raids on families and children was truly awful—and I’ll warn you, this is hard to watch."
John Oliver,"I’m scared, and I’m crying because of my dad and mom. I want my dad. These Hispanic people, they aren’t doing nothing bad. They’re not stealing nothing. My dad bought me everything for me to live over here. The rent. I don’t know where I’m going to eat. I need my dad for me. I don’t know what I’m going to do right now. My dad didn’t do nothing, he’s not a criminal."
John Oliver,"Yeah, we did that. And we’re apparently a coin flip away from going even further. And a lot of Trump supporters seem to be in denial about exactly what a plan of mass deportation would entail. And that’s a frustrating pattern here. In Trump’s first term, this local business owner in Indiana was deported, to the apparent shock of the people in his community."
John Oliver,The community is better for having someone like him.
John Oliver,"I mean, he showed up here with just the shirt on his back, and he’s a restaurant owner 20 years later. I mean, that’s… and he worked his butt off to get there, I’ve seen it."
John Oliver,"They’re all strong supporters of Roberto Beristain, though four out of six of them voted for President Trump. I voted for him because he said he was going to get rid of the bad… the bad hombres. Roberto is a good hombre."
John Oliver,"Well, a couple of things about that. First, if showing up with the shirt on your back and working hard for 20 years makes someone a good hombre, I’ve got some news for you about a whole lot of f*cking immigrants. But also, how do those people even begin to apologize for a situation like that? I don’t think Hallmark sells cards that say, “Sorry we inadvertently got you deported because we assumed Trump would only be racist against Hispanics we didn’t know personally."
John Oliver,"And I really want to hope people are waving around signs without understanding what “mass deportation” actually means in practice. But make no mistake, the people campaigning on it absolutely do, and it’s horrendous."
John Oliver,"So, what can we do? Well, there’s the obvious, and that’s vote. But it’s also worth talking to people in your life who are concerned about immigration about what they really want to happen here. Because our system definitely needs fixing, but there are much more humane ways to do that—and even some Republicans seem open to that idea."
John Oliver,"Because while—as I mentioned earlier—the slogan “mass deportation” polls depressingly well. A recent study showed that when people were actually given a specific choice between mass deportation and pathways to citizenship as an immigration policy—specifically outlining how each might work—majorities in every swing state preferred the path to citizenship. In fact, even among Republicans, in five of six swing states, it was preferred."
John Oliver,"Which suggests that when people genuinely understand what these policies look like, they tend to choose the less punitive one. And I do believe the vast majority want to do what’s right for the immigrants they know. The task is to extend that same humanity to the immigrants they don’t. And that’s a task both parties would do well to adopt."
John Oliver,"Because Democrats have not been stellar on this issue either. Obama holds the record for most deportations in a single year, and Biden’s immigration policies—as we’ve discussed multiple times—have been haphazard at best. So, I’d hope a potential Harris administration would do much better than the one she’s been part of, and begin a much-needed overhaul of a system badly in need of repair."
John Oliver,"immigrants are not the ones that broke this system. On the contrary, they’re making the most of the splintered shards we’ve given them and continuing to build lives, communities, and this country into something better, richer, and stronger. And the very least we can do for them is to go out on November 5th and not pick a president who demonizes their existence, advocates for their suffering, and has proven multiple times that he is, to put it mildly, a bad fucking hombre."
John Oliver,"Moving on. For our second story tonight, we’re going to keep talking about immigration."
John Oliver,"I’m intimately familiar with the U.S. immigration process, having finally become a citizen in 2019. It was a long, stressful process, capped by a moving naturalization ceremony at which, among other things, I gave this awkward thumbs-up and also got this little flag! But one part of the ceremony stuck in my head, and it’s something millions of naturalized citizens have experienced. Here’s footage from a different ceremony that same year, where they explain what’s about to happen."
John Oliver,"At this time, please direct your attention to the front for a congratulatory message from President Donald Trump followed by an inspirational video presentation of God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood ."
John Oliver,"It’s true. Right after a message from the president, everyone there had to sit through a music video for God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood . And it’s exactly as weird as it sounds. Here’s what it was like in that room."
John Oliver,"♪ And I’m proud to be an American ♪ ♪ where at least I know I’m free. ♪ ♪ And I won’t forget the men who died, ♪ ♪ who gave that right o me ♪ ♪ And I’d gladly stand up ♪ next to you. ♪ ♪ And defend her still today. ♪ ♪ Because there ain’t no doubt ♪ I love this land. ♪ ♪ God bless the USA. ♪"
John Oliver,"Yeah, one of the most meaningful moments of your life, everyone feels compelled to awkwardly wave their little flag around while thinking, “How long is this song, exactly?"
John Oliver,"And I got curious about the presence of that song at the ceremony, so we did some digging. But before we get into any of that, a bit of background on God Bless the USA —which is undeniably a patriotic song. Since its release in 1984, it’s had multiple surges in popularity, usually at difficult moments for the country. General Norman Schwarzkopf is said to have played the song to his staff the night before Operation Desert Storm, and after 9/11, it was so ubiquitous, it re-entered the singles charts, peaking at number 16."
John Oliver,"And while Lee Greenwood has repeatedly claimed his song’s apolitical, he definitely isn’t. He’s performed it at a lot of conservative events over the years. Here he is singing it for Ronald Reagan at the 1988 RNC, here he is modifying the words to “God Bless the NRA” for one of their national conventions, and here he is becoming the third person ever inducted into the CPAC Hall of Fame, while receiving an award that looks like the world’s first Ferrero Rocher pigeon."
John Oliver,"More recently, Greenwood’s been a big booster for President Trump. He played his inaugural, introduced Trump at this year’s Republican convention, and serenaded him earlier this month when he returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, making his music the second-worst thing to happen to someone’s ears there."
John Oliver,"Now, interestingly, Greenwood’s never had a hit anywhere close to God Bless the USA, something he insists he’s totally fine with. He’s said, “If you’re going to have to be known for something, be known for something really powerful and really good… I’d hate to have Purple Rain or Margaritaville be my signature song.” Which is just an insane drive-by against two objectively better artists."
John Oliver,"You’d hate to be known for Margaritaville , a song that became a restaurant franchise and a Broadway musical? Bullshit. And I’m not even touching the Purple Rain thing, because Prince isn’t known for Purple Rain , he’s known for being Prince, except for the ‘90s, when he was known for being whatever the fuck this is, and his signature song is all of them."
John Oliver,"But the truth is, a lot of people do love God Bless the USA, and Greenwood’s found as many ways as possible to monetize that fact, selling God Bless the USA fireworks, a children’s book, silver coins, and even this: “Introducing the limited-edition God Bless the USA Bible, inspired by Lee Greenwood’s patriotic anthem. This large-print, leather-bound King James Bible also contains America’s founding documents: the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Pledge of Allegiance, along with a handwritten chorus to Lee Greenwood’s song God Bless the USA.” John : If doing that to a Bible seems odd to you, you’re not alone. Even Christianity Today published a blog post criticizing it, saying, “We agree that it is essential to know the content of this nation’s founding documents. We do not believe, however, that they should be published as though they are an extension of God’s word.” A line of critique the president of the marketing company that created the Bible responded to by saying, “It’s got separation pages.” To which I really hope Christianity Today responded, “Oh, separation pages, la-di-dah. We didn’t know it had separation pages, fuck you."
John Oliver,"But they probably didn’t do that, because, you know."
John Oliver,"Also, for what it’s worth, this doesn’t really look separated. That’s the printed words of the Bible next to the handwritten words of a song chorus, looking like a yearbook signature from your worst classmate. “Proud to be an American where at least I know I’m free?” Jesus Christ, Dylan C, just write “Keep in touch,” space is limited, and you’re not even hot. Oh, one more thing, that Bible costs $60."
John Oliver,"And if you’re thinking, “Who’d be so nakedly crass to be associated with a $60 Lee Greenwood -branded Bible?” You already know the answer to that. *”I’m proud to be partnering with my very good friend Lee Greenwood . Who"
John Oliver,"♪ ’Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land, God bless you, Canada. ♪"
John Oliver,"It doesn’t even fucking rhyme! It doesn’t rhyme! You can’t keep “defend her still today” if you’re not willing to sing “God bless you, Canad-ay!” You can’t do it! But the point is, he took his quintessentially American song and switched a few words so it’d be about Canada instead. The rest of it is him just find-and-replacing Canadian places for American ones. Take a listen."
John Oliver,"From the shores of Nova Scotia to the forests in B.C., Montreal to Winnipeg, from sea to shining sea."
John Oliver,"Oh, come on. You can’t just pack your song in with place names like a Mad Libs and call it a day. You know why? Because you’ll get real YouTube comments like this one, saying, “I am from Rwanda and Mr. Greenwood has not made a version for us yet.” It’s a slippery slope, Lee !"
John Oliver,"All of this is to say that, for multiple reasons, I’d argue Lee Greenwood’s song should never again be played at citizenship ceremonies. Because they deserve one genuinely unique to this country. A song that celebrates the nation new Americans are about to join—and the process they’ve been through—while also not soft-pedaling some hard truths about it."
John Oliver,"And the good news is, I think we have the perfect song, performed by an actual American treasure. And not only will we not charge the government $700 a year for it—we’re not assholes—we’ll actually pay them $701 a year if they play it at naturalization ceremonies from now on."
John Oliver,"I could tell you more about it, but honestly, I’d rather show it to you."
