John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 12 Episode 3 Aired on March 3, 2025"
John Oliver,"John Oliver discusses tipping, why it’s more complicated and fraught than you might realize, how we can address some of the issues surrounding it, and whether or not he deserves 25% at the end of this story."
John Oliver,"Our main story tonight concerns restaurants, one of the dumbest things we’ve used HBO’s money to pay for—tied with Russell Crowe’s jockstrap, this giant cake, and the contractual day rate of Armie Hammer (three days, plus transportation, by the way). There’s not a lot to say. More broadly, we’re going to talk about tipping."
John Oliver,"Lately, we’re not just seeing it in restaurants—we’re being asked to do it everywhere, and people are fed up."
John Oliver,"I’m purchasing an office chair online, and they’re asking me if I want to leave a tip!” “Are we tipping at drive-throughs?” “The airport in New Jersey just asked me to tip at self-checkout—tip myself? I did all the work! Who am I tipping?” “We got Fro-Yo last night, and it was self-serve. Then, when I go to pay, the kid at the register is like, ‘It’s just going to ask you a question,’ and the question says: ‘How much tip do you want to leave?’ I was like, ‘What the fuck am I tipping you for? It was literally self-serve! I grabbed the container, I pulled the lever, I even sprinkled the cookie dough bites! If anybody’s getting a tip around here, it’s me!’"
John Oliver,"Okay, okay. First, nobody should ever be getting that worked up about frozen yogurt—it is ice cream for people who hate themselves. That said, I do agree that you should be able to tip yourself when you do a good job. In fact, I’m going to start something tonight: I’m putting a little bit of money into this jar every time I make a good joke or a salient point. Watch this space."
John Oliver,"In fact, nearly three in four people think tipping culture has gotten out of control. There are so many stories of people being asked to tip in weird places—from one woman saying her mortgage company has been asking for tips lately, to another sharing how her Chevy Cruze got towed and when she went to the impound lot and it came time to pay, on the screen, additional gratuity options appeared."
John Oliver,And getting asked to tip at an impound lot might seem like the craziest possible example—until you see this TikTok of a fully automated coffee kiosk:
John Oliver,You want a fucking tip? Are you serious?
John Oliver,"Look, I think we can all agree that is ridiculous. Especially because that piece of machinery with googly eyes doesn’t want a tip—all it wants is the sweet release of death and to be welcomed into the kingdom of heaven. But news flash, robot—that’s never going to happen. You’re not getting into heaven. You know why? Say it with me, folks:"
John Oliver,Exactly. Bingo bango. Enjoy robot hell. Down you go. And stay there.
John Oliver,I will eliminate taxes on tips for restaurant workers and hospitality workers and anyone else relying on tips. No more taxes on tips. No taxes on tips. None. None!
John Oliver,"Look, Trump may be the most predictable man who has ever lived, but at least he’s out there trying to generate suspense at random points in the middle of otherwise normal sentences."
John Oliver,"Once every three or four minutes, he belts out a random word like he’s announcing it as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live ."
John Oliver,"But it is true—Trump has promised to eliminate taxes on tips, and Kamala Harris followed suit, adopting a similar proposal. And right now, lawmakers are deciding whether or not this proposal will make it into the budget. But the thing is, tipping is actually a lot more complicated and fraught than you may realize."
John Oliver,"So, given that, tonight let’s talk about tipping—why we do it, what the problems with it are, and how we might be able to address at least some of them."
John Oliver,"And let’s start with the fact that tipping here is way more pervasive than in most of the world. In Europe, tipping is much less of a norm, while in Japan, it can even be considered embarrassing and awkward. And Americans traveling abroad sometimes find wait staff confused if they try to tip, as this man discovered in Amsterdam:"
John Oliver,"We got a few beers, and I left like a five on the table. They were like, “Oh, you forgot this.” I’m like, “Oh no, that’s for you.” They said, “Why?"
John Oliver,"And you know, if they ask why , it means they’re probably getting paid fine. Like, they didn’t see that and go, “Oh yeah!"
John Oliver,"If you saw somebody in Portland and a five was on a table, and they didn’t know why, they’d be like, “All right, five bucks!"
John Oliver,That tells you something about the culture of your economy and how you treat your workers.
John Oliver,Right. You know a country is in pretty good shape when their workers turn down free money.
John Oliver,"We do not need your $5, for we are each given a fair wage, and universal healthcare, and a beautiful windmill to sleep in at night, and all the tulips that we can eat. Truly, it is paradise here in the Netherlands."
John Oliver,"No, but while tipping is now mainly known as an American affectation, its origin is commonly traced back to Tudor England, when visitors to private homes were expected to give sums of money at the end of a visit for services rendered by the host’s servants. Hundreds of years later, visiting Americans brought the custom back home with them, and it really took off after the Civil War, when some employers hired formerly enslaved people, paid them low wages, and then encouraged customers to leave tips."
John Oliver,"And I will say, there’s consistently been pushback against this practice."
John Oliver,"William Howard Taft was once referred to as the “patron saint of the anti-tip crusaders”, which is a fantastic spin on ‘cheap bastard’."
John Oliver,"Meanwhile, Ralph Waldo Emerson complained about tipping for bad service, writing:"
John Oliver,"I confess with shame that I sometimes succumb and give the dollar. Yet, it is a wicked dollar, by which, by and by, I shall have the manhood to withhold."
John Oliver,"And while it’s fine to wish you’ll one day be strong enough to resist pressure to tip, I’m just going to say it:"
John Oliver,"That guy would have absolutely crumbled in the face of this robot. He’d have signed his house over to that googly-eyed monster, even if it got his order wrong."
John Oliver,"The anti-tipping movement grew so pervasive in the early 20th century that six states passed laws criminalizing the practice. But that obviously did not last, and nowadays, tipping is everywhere. Though, it can seem like no one really understands the rules of when and how much to tip."
John Oliver,Even one of the leading academic experts on tipping has said:
John Oliver,"I don’t know how much you’re supposed to tip, and I study this."
John Oliver,"It’s gotten to the point where some consumers are now opting out of the system altogether, like this guy:"
John Oliver,"So, I’m not tipping anymore. I’m done. I’m out. Used to be, you would give a tip if somebody gave exceptional service. When was the last time you got exceptional service anywhere? They made food, I carried it to my table, you got me a Diet Coke—thank you, that was your job. You don’t get 25% because you did your job. And I’m not the bad guy here. I’m not!"
John Oliver,"Yeah… Are you 100% sure about that, though? Because you can be irritated with our current system of tipping, but protesting it by stiffing your server is about as effective as protesting police budgets by flipping off a police dog. He has nothing to do with the policy, and the only life you’re making worse is his. Also, between advocating for stiffing waiters and his ‘I Heart Fossil Fuels’ t-shirt, I’m just going to take a stab here—you might actually be the bad guy."
John Oliver,"But, to understand why just not tipping is such a bad idea, it helps to understand exactly who works for tips and how they get paid. Because while you might primarily think of servers at restaurants, who do make up a large share of those who work for tips, tipped workers can also include:"
John Oliver,"In fact, under federal law, workers can be classified as tipped workers if they receive just $30 a month in tips. And that distinction really matters. Because in most states, employers can legally pay tipped workers a much lower base wage, as these cartoon graphics will explain:"
John Oliver,The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
John Oliver,"But if you’re a tipped worker, it’s $2.13 per hour—also referred to as the subminimum wage."
John Oliver,"Yeah. The federal subminimum wage, sometimes called the tipped minimum wage, is just $2.13 an hour. And it’s been at that level since 1991. It may be the most depressing thing that we’re still having to live with from that year, were it not for the fact that 1991 was also the year that the Supreme Court was joined by this fucking guy here:"
John Oliver,"By the way, the Motorcoach option is off the table. Big mistake. Huge."
John Oliver,"Now, for what it’s worth, many states choose to set a wage higher than that, but only these seven—( graphic appears )—and a handful of cities have the same minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped workers alike. Meaning that everywhere else, the expectation is that some workers can be paid less because their tips will make up the difference. But the thing is, $2.13 sometimes isn’t even enough to cover payroll taxes, as this worker explains:"
John Oliver,"In Indiana, you make $2.13 an hour.” “Two thirteen an hour?” “Yeah. You don’t see a paycheck. Your paycheck literally says, ‘This is not a check.’” “It says $0?” “This is not a check. Cuz it—it just goes to taxes. So basically, you’re starting at zero."
John Oliver,Right. You can literally be given a check that has “THIS IS NOT A CHECK” written on it. And come on… Who is writing those paychecks—René Magritte?!
John Oliver,"Hi. If you’re seeing this, you have “explained the joke to me” toggled on your HBO account. René Magritte was a Belgian surrealist painter, whose most famous works include this painting of a pipe with the words “This is not a pipe” beneath it—because, of course, it isn’t a pipe. It’s a painting."
John Oliver,"That might seem banale now, but trust me, if you were sitting in a French art museum in 1929, this blew your fucking mind. People were speaking in tongues, throwing up in response—it was a regular Rite of Spring scene."
John Oliver,"Hi. You hit the button again. Rite of Spring is a work by Igor Stravinsky that was supposedly so avant-garde it caused riots at its first performance. Apparently, Camille Saint-Saëns stormed out of the premiere, although admittedly, that claim is now in some dispute. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really do need to get back to the show."
John Oliver,"Takes some fucking balls, though, right?"
John Oliver,"The point is, you can make as little as $2.13 an hour, and if what you make in tips doesn’t get you all the way up to minimum wage, theoretically , your employer is supposed to cover the difference through what is called the tip credit. But that can be hard for employers to keep track of, and it’s a system that’s easy to cheat. It’s been said that the tip credit is often abused at the employees’ expense, with one restaurant worker saying:"
John Oliver,"As long as I’ve been doing this, I have never, ever—not one time—met anyone who’s been compensated for a below-minimum pay period."
John Oliver,"So the fact is, a lot of tipped workers’ pay may come down to how much someone chooses to leave as gratuity."
John Oliver,"And if you’ve ever worked for tips, you know you can do very well—though that can depend on not just where you work, but when you work, or even what mood your customers happen to be in."
John Oliver,As this former hospitality worker explains:
John Oliver,"If you come in on a Tuesday—I mean, some people party on a Tuesday, but not as much as Saturday. Put yourself in a tipped worker’s shoes: could you survive off of $2.50 an hour and rely on the drunk guy in front of you to pay your rent?"
John Oliver,"Right. Someone’s ability to pay their rent can be dependent on a person who may be drunk or partying on a Tuesday—or, if they happen to be the current Defense Secretary, very likely both."
John Oliver,"And all this might help explain why recent analyses have found that poverty rates for tipped workers are over twice as high as for non-tipped workers. And some tend to be more disadvantaged by this than others. Studies have found that both Black and white consumers tip white servers more than Black ones. And one paper found that waitresses in their 30s, and those with large breasts, blonde hair, and/or slender bodies, received larger average tips than their counterparts without these characteristics. And look, it is not news that life is somewhat easier for attractive people. I would know—I was featured in Vogue in 2015 in a gallery titled, and this is true:"
John Oliver,10 Unconventional Alternatives to the Sexiest Man Alive.
John Oliver,"Who was, at the time, by the way, David Beckham."
John Oliver,"You know, life is just different for us—whether you’re the sexiest man alive or his, quote, “unconventional alternative."
John Oliver,"But obviously, those higher tips can come with a lot of unwanted harassment. And if servers are making a subminimum wage, they might feel especially pressured to put up with that in order to make a living. And there is one final twist here, which is that a server’s tips may not even be entirely theirs. In some restaurants, there’s an expectation that servers will “tip out”—or share a portion of their tips with other restaurant personnel. And depending on how that’s set up, it can really put servers in a bind. Here’s that woman you saw a minute ago, explaining how it worked for her:"
John Oliver,"You have to tip out. I mean, most restaurants, it’s roughly 3 to 5% of your sales. So, like—even if people are tipping the 20% that is standard for great service, most servers are tipping out 3 to 5% of that to busers, hosts, and bartenders."
John Oliver,What if I leave you nothing? What happens?
John Oliver,"Then we still have to pay that tip out—whether you give us money or not. So, say your bill is $100, and I have to tip out 5%. If you don’t tip me at all, I’m paying $5 to wait on you out of my own pocket."
John Oliver,"That is true at some places. Not only are you subsidizing the servers, but they may be subsidizing other members of staff, too. And if that seems less like a business and more like an insane money carousel, where everyone is paying everyone else and somehow everyone is still poor— Welcome to the restaurant industry."
John Oliver,"And at this point, you might be thinking:"
John Oliver,"Well, fuck this whole system . Why don’t we just get rid of it?"
John Oliver,And you would not be the first to suggest that.
John Oliver,"Here’s that guy you saw earlier, gaming out the system he’d rather see:"
John Oliver,"If you own a restaurant, just tell me what it costs. I don’t want people to go hungry. What does it cost for me to get my food—and also so that the waitstaff doesn’t have to join the cartel, do some Lord of the Flies, Oliver Twist-like—I want people to be taken care of. Just tell me what it costs!"
John Oliver,"Now, that might sound reasonable—"
John Oliver,"( The paying a fair price for what I’m getting part, not the absolute avalanche of fearing that waitstaff would “join the cartel” or do some Lord of the Flies or Oliver Twist-like thing—whatever the f uck that could mean.)"
John Oliver,"I don’t know what versions of either of those books he’s read, but Lord of the Flies and Oliver Twist had some very different answers for what children will get up to when unsupervised—and neither of them seem like they’d apply to workers making the tipped minimum wage."
John Oliver,"But unfortunately, when many people say “Just tell me what it costs”, they also mean:"
John Oliver,"And it better cost exactly the same, or I am going to be pissed."
John Oliver,I’ve done the research where I give people hypothetical menus:
John Oliver,He then asked people how expensive they thought the restaurant was. People overwhelmingly thought the menu with the 15% higher prices was more expensive than a menu where they would tip 15% or more anyway.
John Oliver,"Yeah, even if the amount of money coming out of your pocket is the exact same both times, people view the menu with built-in tip prices as more expensive—because it just feels more expensive. It’s sort of the same way that it feels like I’m older than David Beckham—even though, fun fact, I’m two years younger than him. He’s aging incredibly, and I think I’m… tickling ?"
John Oliver,"And that has led people to try and come up with other ways to relieve the financial stress on tipped workers, which brings us all the way back to Trump’s promise to eliminate taxes on tips. It’s an idea that he was proud to reveal had a notable celebrity backer:"
John Oliver,"[TRUMP] “On your receipt, when you get your receipt for a restaurant—you know who sent me one? Kid Rock! How good is Kid Rock, isn’t he? But he sent me a receipt, and he wrote on the receipt: ‘Vote for Trump and you won’t pay taxes on tips.’ He wrote that on the receipt. I said, ‘That’s very smart. That’s very smart. Smart guy.’"
John Oliver,"So for restaurant workers, for hotel workers, for caddies—for car people—it’s a lot! But anybody receiving tips—there’s no more tax on tips! And I think that’s going to be a great thing!"
John Oliver,"Okay, there is so much to deal with there— From the phrase “car people,” to (again) the surprise punctuation on “caddies,” to the fact that the President is taking policy advice from Kid Rock—"
John Oliver,A man who constantly looks like he’s on trial for something called moonshine fraud.
John Oliver,"But the thing is, that idea has broad support. It’s a proposal supported by roughly three in four Republicans, Democrats, and Independents."
John Oliver,"And look, I’m all for giving a tax break to low-wage workers, but you should know:"
John Oliver,A lot of economists have major concerns with this particular policy—starting with the fact that the tax relief it gives would be haphazard at best.
John Oliver,One of the ways to make taxes fair is to make sure that people of the same income level are paying approximately the same amount of taxes.
John Oliver,"And in this case, you really wouldn’t be doing that."
John Oliver,"But I can’t think of a good reason why you’d want to give a tax break to the person who delivers food, but not to the person who delivers mail."
John Oliver,"Right. That doesn’t make much sense, does it? If someone delivering packages for Amazon makes the same as someone delivering food for DoorDash, it doesn’t feel fair for one of them to be taxed significantly more."
John Oliver,"( Although, if we’re going to be even fairer, we’d probably tax the guy who owns the company that sends out those packages a ton more as well. But that’s not what we’re talking about tonight. )"
John Oliver,"The point is, Trump’s plan would essentially be a tax break for only the 2.5% of American workers who work for tips. And not even all of those—given that more than a third of tipped workers had incomes low enough that they face no federal income tax to begin with."
John Oliver,And that’s not the only issue with this idea. It’s also a policy that could be exploited. For instance:
John Oliver,Prompts to tip could start showing up in whole new categories of consumer transactions.
John Oliver,( So you might actually be prompted to tip even more than you are right now. )
John Oliver,"The point is, while “No tax on tips” is an easy applause line at rallies, it wouldn’t be nearly as effective as it sounds. If you really want to give relief to tipped workers, I’d argue the solution would be to eliminate the subminimum wage."
John Oliver,"Everyone gets at least the minimum wage, and then your tip goes on top of that."
John Oliver,It’s a proposal that this advocacy group [OFW – One Fair Wage] has been pushing for nationwide. But I will acknowledge—not everyone is on board with this idea.
John Oliver,"In Michigan, there’s been an ongoing fight over raising its subminimum wage, and even some who might stand to benefit do have concerns:"
John Oliver,"That’s what keeps my lights on. That’s what keeps me going back, for sure."
John Oliver,"Because she makes tips, her minimum wage is about $4 an hour."
John Oliver,"Soon, that’ll change, and she’ll make minimum wage like any other worker—which, right now, is roughly $10 an hour in Michigan."
John Oliver,"When people start to realize you’re making hourly wages, um… they’ll tip less. They’ll be like, ‘Wow, they’re already making their minimum wage, which is 10-something an hour.’"
John Oliver,"Yeah, I could see worrying about that. And while I’m not saying it’s the only reason she feels that way, having what seems to be her boss standing 3 feet away, staring daggers at the camera, might also have something to do with it. But I do get those concerns. Although it is worth remembering:"
John Oliver,There are seven states that haven’t had a subminimum wage for decades. And yet… people still tip there.
John Oliver,"In fact, one study found that tipped workers in those states typically earn 10 to 20% more in wages and tips."
John Oliver,"And I’m not saying switching over is easy. There are good-faith concerns from restaurant owners, who are often operating on very thin margins, about what sudden pay hikes could mean. That’s why, in many places where the subminimum wage has been eliminated, it’s been done gradually—so that restaurants can figure out an approach that works for them, like:"
John Oliver,"Where it’s been done, the restaurant industry hasn’t imploded."
John Oliver,"Flagstaff, Arizona, has been incrementally doing away with its subminimum wage since 2017—and both:"
John Oliver,"Meanwhile, Washington, D.C. is now two years into its phase-out, so it’s still too early to know the full impact. But numbers currently don’t show any obvious problems on the jobs front:"
John Oliver,But maybe the clearest expression of the difference eliminating the subminimum wage can make is looking at states that have done it vs. their neighboring states that haven’t.
John Oliver,"Just watch as a waitress in Wisconsin—which still has a subminimum wage for tipped workers—is asked about Minnesota, which got rid of it:"
John Oliver,That’s not great. You shouldn’t lose thousands of dollars just because you’re in Wisconsin—especially because those dollars are actually more useful there. Because Wisconsin is where the National Mustard Museum is.
John Oliver,That’s the kind of thing you want some extra cash for!
John Oliver,"So, when you take all of this together, a few things are clear about tipping:"
John Oliver,"1. It’s unlikely to ever go away completely. At this point, it’s just too culturally ingrained, no matter what happens."
John Oliver,"2. It isn’t really a “gratuity” anymore. In a lot of places, it’s an absolute necessity. So, if you’re eating at a restaurant, you have to tip."
John Oliver,And there are other jobs where that might also be the case—up to and including:
John Oliver,Now… does that mean you should also be tipping at an impound lot? NO! Absolutely not. Should you be tipping this robot? Fuck NO! That shouldn’t happen under any circumstances. That robot should go to hell. And it will.
John Oliver,"But if you didn’t know that workers in most states rely on tips to make up for subminimum wages, well… Now you do. And if you’d rather a tip be just a little bonus, instead of critical to someone’s survival— That’s great! That means you support eliminating the subminimum wage—and you should feel free to yell at your state and federal lawmakers about it. But if you’re considering withholding tips to prove some kind of point about the unfairness of the industry… I hate to say it— You might be the bad guy."
John Oliver,"Anyway, that is the end of this story. And it’s the end of this episode. For those of you at home, your screen’s just going to ask you a question real quick— Just go ahead and tap to make your selection. No pressure. But we worked pretty hard. And if you fell asleep, but there is a cat that’s still awake in your home… Just mash your little paws at the screen. D-D—Daddy wants some money. That’s our show! Thanks so much for watching. We’ll see you next week. Good night!"
John Oliver,"( Not 15% over here—we’ll take the 25%, please! We worked hard this week! Get it, get it, get it, get it! Cat—25—25—get it! Get it! )"
Main Segment,"Tipping Other segments: The Silicon Valley Auto Show, 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy meeting, Kash Patel and Dan Bongino’s leadership at the FBI"
The Point Is,"people are furious at how often they’re seeing the tip screen. It is now the least welcome way to encounter an iPad in public, outside of that guy watching Pornhub on the bus ."
The Point Is,"you’re not wrong for thinking tip requests are showing up in more places. But as frustrating as that can be, lots of people depend on tips for their livelihood. And this subject took center stage last year when Trump made this bold promise:"
Interviewer,"What if someone said to you, ‘Wow, we’re going to be just like your neighbors over there in Minnesota, and you’re going to get minimum wage as your base salary plus your tips’?"
Waitress,"I would love that! I actually know some people who, um, used to work in Minnesota as servers. And then they came over here… and they realized that they’re only making $2.33. And they’re like, ‘I’m literally losing thousands of dollars by coming over here in Wisconsin.’"
