John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 12 Episode 4 Aired on March 9, 2025"
John Oliver,"John Oliver discusses ICE detention facilities, who’s in them, who runs them and – of course – why it is totally understandable if our studio audience would rather watch Drew Barrymore’s show instead."
John Oliver,"[John] Our main story tonight concerns immigration—the surprising subject of the White House’s actual Valentine’s Day tweet, which read:"
John Oliver,"Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally and we’ll deport you."
John Oliver,"Though, I guess that’s exactly the kind of romance you’d expect from a house occupied by this loving couple."
John Oliver,"Since Trump took office, he’s made a big show of having ICE conduct immigration raids, often with news cameras and even Dr. Phil tagging along to try and generate positive coverage—though it hasn’t always gone well. For instance, they raided apartment complexes in Colorado that were supposedly centers of gang activity, only to return with very few arrests and some humiliating footage."
John Oliver,"As the team went door to door, they found blood-stained walls but no gang members. The entire complex was virtually empty. At a second Trende Raglink complex, ICE was met by activists who taunted them:"
John Oliver,[Applause] “What the f* is wrong with you? Get out of our community!”**
John Oliver,"Excellent! We all need more of that woman’s energy. I don’t know what she has in that mug, but I do know what she doesn’t have—any f*s left to give.**"
John Oliver,"These raids are in fulfillment of Trump’s campaign promise to implement the largest deportation operation in American history. And to do that, it seems every week he devises a new place to send migrants—from Costa Rica, to Panama, to even this:"
John Oliver,"The latest piece of the mass deportation puzzle: bringing as many as 30,000 criminal migrants to the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay."
John Oliver,"[Trump] “So we’re going to send them out to Guantanamo. This will double our capacity immediately, right? And tough—that’s a tough—that’s a tough place to get out of."
John Oliver,"[John] I mean… yeah, it is. Although calling GMO (Guantanamo Bay) a tough place to get out of is a bit of an understatement."
John Oliver,"Last month, Trump actually flew 178 Venezuelan migrants there—only to quickly reverse course and fly them out after the administration started facing lawsuits. And look, most experts agree that for both legal and logistical reasons, GMO is unlikely to house 30,000 migrants anytime soon."
John Oliver,And what that means is most of the people who get arrested are going to be funneled into our existing immigration detention facilities.
John Oliver,I know we’ve talked on this show a lot about our immigration system’s problems before:
John Oliver,"But tonight, we’re going to focus very narrowly on detention centers. They don’t tend to get talked about much, despite the fact that a lot of people go through them."
John Oliver,"ICE currently has the budget to hold just over 41,000 people on any given day, and last year, more than 260,000 people cycled through ICE detention in total."
John Oliver,"But Trump is already talking about sending even more people into that system, which in some quarters is cause for celebration."
John Oliver,"After the election, stock prices for private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic soared—with their CEOs each bragging to investors about how much money they were going to make:"
John Oliver,"The GEO Group was built for this unique moment in our company’s and country’s history, and the opportunities that it will bring."
John Oliver,"I’ve worked at CoreCivic for 32 years, and this is truly one of the most exciting periods in my career with the company."
John Oliver,"[John] Look, as a general rule, if something happens that causes a private prison company to get really excited, that thing was bad."
John Oliver,If you ever come home and your spouse tells you:
John Oliver,"Honey, I did something today, and the GEO Group is super excited about it."
John Oliver,You are in for a relationship-altering conversation.
John Oliver,"And the thing is, immigration detention facilities are by law not supposed to be a punishment. ICE’s own website even states that detention is non-punitive."
John Oliver,"Though, as you’re about to see, that’s like claiming that:"
John Oliver,"It is a bold assertion, sharply undercut by empirical evidence."
John Oliver,"So, given all of that, tonight, let’s talk about ICE detention facilities and try to answer a few basic questions:"
John Oliver,Trump and those around him often try and sell their immigration roundups as being about cracking down on crime.
John Oliver,Here’s his press secretary answering a question about exactly who was arrested in the first round of ICE raids:
John Oliver,"The 3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office."
John Oliver,"[John] Well, hold on, because that is not actually true."
John Oliver,"While entering the U.S. without authorization can be a criminal offense, many of those who are undocumented entered legally and overstayed their visas. Simply being undocumented is a civil violation, not a criminal one."
John Oliver,That is an important distinction that her boss should frankly understand—given that he has committed both.
John Oliver,"As of last year, almost half of those in ICE custody were seeking asylum. And that is actually true for some of those who got scooped up in Colorado last month."
John Oliver,"One man got detained even though he had done everything he was supposed to do. He committed no crimes and had an asylum hearing court date. And yet, despite that, listen to his brother describe what happened:"
John Oliver,"[Testimony] On Wednesday, Luis’s brother, Yonathan, was driving him to work."
John Oliver,"No ID, though. ID—they didn’t even get past the parking lot at the Cedar Run apartment complex, where ICE detained at least five people as part of a raid Wednesday."
John Oliver,Luis says ICE officers wouldn’t accept his brother’s paperwork even though he showed his asylum documents as he waited on a work permit.
John Oliver,He has so many questions about how his brother was detained without a criminal record.
John Oliver,"If he doesn’t have a deportation order, how can they take him?"
John Oliver,"[John] Yeah, that’s a good question. It’s actually one of many things I find hard to understand about watching that—including why those agents were wearing camouflage while doing it."
John Oliver,"You’re in a parking lot, not dense foliage. If you actually wanted to blend in, you should have dressed up like a Claire’s accessories store in a strip mall."
John Oliver,"The thing is, holding someone in detention is only meant to be done in limited circumstances, like if they’re a flight risk or to make sure they show up for an immigration hearing."
John Oliver,But the vast majority do show up for those hearings because they want their case heard.
John Oliver,"For those with asylum claims—like that guy’s brother—a recent study found that of those who weren’t detained, 95% attended all of their Immigration Court hearings."
John Oliver,"Now, there are some immigrants who are subject to what’s called mandatory detention, like if they’ve been accused of breaking the law."
John Oliver,"That used to be confined to serious offenses like murder or gun trafficking, but that all changed when Bill Clinton expanded it to also cover minor crimes—from low-level drug convictions to writing a bad check."
John Oliver,And those convictions don’t even have to be recent.
John Oliver,"Take this man, who was brought from Jamaica to the U.S. by his family when he was a teenager. He served in the military, but after completing his service, pled guilty to marijuana possession in 1997."
John Oliver,"He moved on, started a business and a family—but then, in 2010, this suddenly happened:"
John Oliver,"[Testimony] “About 5:30 in the morning, I heard a big knock on the door—BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM."
John Oliver,"And I opened the door, and then it was like—‘Did you apply for citizenship like six months ago?’"
John Oliver,And they were like—‘Turn around. That’s why we’re here.’
John Oliver,"I didn’t think that in 2010, the marijuana conviction that happened 14 years ago would have come back to haunt me."
John Oliver,"No one should be punished for a minor mistake they made 14 years earlier—otherwise, I’d have hell to pay for playing Vanity Smurf in the 2011 Smurfs movie."
John Oliver,I was already punished when I saw it—and again when I had to pose for this press photo.
John Oliver,"The point is, that Clinton-era expansion supercharged the detained population, which passed 20,000 in 2001, only to expand through Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden to the point where we now have the world’s largest immigration detention system."
John Oliver,"Which would be a massive embarrassment—because America has the world’s largest of a lot of things, and they’re mostly either awesome or at worst fantastically weird."
John Oliver,It is seven stories tall—not including the handles.
John Oliver,"And fun fact—it doubled as the headquarters for Longaberger, a basket manufacturing company in Ohio."
John Oliver,"It was apparently the brainchild of the company’s founder, who wrote in his memoir:"
John Oliver,"I figured if Walt Disney could build an empire around a mouse, the Longaberger home office building could resemble a basket."
John Oliver,"Whenever I talked about it, people looked at me like I was nuts."
John Oliver,"Sadly, the company vacated the basket in 2016, and it’s been abandoned ever since."
John Oliver,"Though, you can find videos online of admirers who’ve made pilgrimages to see it since then—like this one:"
John Oliver,"I don’t think the pictures are doing it justice. This looks way, way bigger in person than when I was seeing it in photos for a very long time."
John Oliver,And here I am… in the shadow of a seven-story basket.
John Oliver,More companies need to do this—build their offices and headquarters in oversized buildings shaped like their products.
John Oliver,[John] I could not agree more with that. I’ve been saying the same thing for years.
John Oliver,"All that said, I’d argue that being home to the empty, decaying carcass of the world’s largest basket office is still significantly less embarrassing than being home to the world’s largest immigration detention system."
John Oliver,"I bet you forgot what I was even talking about, but I knew where I was going with this."
John Oliver,"And while the average length of stay for a person in ICE custody is just over 44 days, that is just an average."
John Oliver,"And that is the thing—if you are sent into detention, you don’t know how long you’ll be there."
John Oliver,There is no set timetable for your release.
John Oliver,And even some of those in charge of these centers can almost acknowledge the problems with that:
John Oliver,[Testimony] “It’s not like a—a—a jail inmate that’s in here sentenced to a certain time. They know the day they get out. They have no idea when they’re—when they’re going to leave.
John Oliver,"And I know—I mean, if—if I was in their place, it would be very difficult to not know when I’m leaving."
John Oliver,"You know, people see it sometimes as—as a punishment. We don’t punish, so—so it’s—I know it’s viewed that way, but—but we aren’t going to hold somebody to—to punish them."
John Oliver,"[John] Okay, but the thing is, being locked up and not knowing when you get to leave is basically the definition of a punishment."
John Oliver,Just ask this studio audience right now.
John Oliver,"Not only are they stuck here, they have no idea when this is going to be over."
John Oliver,"They’re just trapped in this room, getting sleepier by the minute, wishing this was a taping of Drew ."
John Oliver,"Sorry, guys—she’s in the studio next door."
John Oliver,"So that’s who’s in these facilities, but where exactly are they?"
John Oliver,"Well, sometimes ICE detains people in local jails, which is already a little weird given that, again, ICE detention is supposed to be non-punitive."
John Oliver,"But the vast majority—over 90%, in fact—are held in facilities owned or operated by private prison companies."
John Oliver,That is why those CEOs were so excited on their earnings calls—because these companies make a ton of money out of detaining immigrants.
John Oliver,"In fact, America’s very first private prison was built for immigration detention."
John Oliver,American business is becoming bullish on prison.
John Oliver,"Firms like the Corrections Corporation of America in Nashville, Tennessee, believe there will be no business like jail business in the 1980s."
John Oliver,"This construction site in Houston, Texas, will soon become the first completely free-enterprise prison in the United States—designed, built, owned, and operated by a business corporation."
John Oliver,It is being built for the U.S. Justice Department to detain up to 300 aliens charged with entering this country illegally and awaiting deportation hearings.
John Oliver,The market is enormous. There are over half a million people in this country incarcerated at the present time.
John Oliver,"The sheer, unblinking creepiness of that man alone is a little distracting, as is the weirdly upbeat tone of the rest of the segment."
John Oliver,No business like jail business” isn’t something you should be saying in a news report.
John Oliver,It sounds like a musical where Bernadette Peters shanks someone in their sleep.
John Oliver,"And the fact is, business has been good for private prisons ever since:"
John Oliver,And you can see why this is such an appealing model for ICE—they get to outsource the headaches and responsibilities of these facilities.
John Oliver,"Sometimes, ICE even adds another layer of removal by contracting with local governments, who then in turn contract with private companies."
John Oliver,That is attractive because those particular arrangements are subjected to significantly less scrutiny than is required for ordinary federal contracts.
John Oliver,So this system seems to work great for the companies and for ICE… but it works much less well for anyone who needs to go through it.
John Oliver,Let’s start with the fact that they’re often located in incredibly remote areas.
John Oliver,That is actually a big deal because it means detainees can be cut off from legal representation.
John Oliver,"So, I leave my house in the mornings, um, get on the road, typically just try to power all the way through to the detention center."
John Oliver,"We typically go only to Pine Prairie, and so that’s about a three, three-and-a-half-hour drive."
John Oliver,"Um, today, we’re making the trip up to Jackson for some special cases, and so that’s a four-and-a-half, five-hour—depending on traffic—drive."
John Oliver,"[John] Yeah, that is a big problem, especially given that:"
John Oliver,I know I make fun of them sometimes because lawyer used to be this guy’s job…
John Oliver,"We’d have been shut down years ago, after being sued into oblivion for sexual harassment by Adam Driver."
John Oliver,"And that is before you get to the conditions inside these facilities, which can be hard to see as ICE heavily controls access."
John Oliver,The glimpses you tend to get are either from:
John Oliver,"Like this one about a New Mexico facility, owned by a company called MTC:"
John Oliver,The Otero facility hosts various sporting tournaments and other activities to keep the men engaged.
John Oliver,"Just like the Imperial facility, detainees have access to medical and dental care."
John Oliver,MTC staff are trained to treat detainees with great respect and dignity.
John Oliver,"We call it a ‘BIONIC’—Believe It Or Not, I Care—approach."
John Oliver,"[John] Okay… If your starting point to saying “I care” is “Believe it or not”, you’ve already got off on the wrong foot."
John Oliver,"Believe it or not, I don’t draw erotic fanfiction of the Honey Nut Cheerios bee."
John Oliver,The very fact I said “Believe it or not” suggests you already assumed that I do.
John Oliver,It’s an assumption that is already damning on its own.
John Oliver,"Cartoon bumblebee-wise, this, for instance, does nothing for me:"
John Oliver,"And for what it’s worth, I definitely didn’t draw any of these myself."
John Oliver,"And while they paint a lovely picture, the fact is:"
John Oliver,Conditions in ICE detention can be brutal.
John Oliver,"For instance, detainees are often expected to do a lot of the cooking and cleaning themselves."
John Oliver,"And while ICE does require those jobs to be paid, the amount is pitifully small."
John Oliver,"GEO Group was once sued over this at one of its facilities, and in court, they made a bold argument that the judge wanted no part of:"
John Oliver,"GEO’s Lawyer: “Disciplinary segregation can be used as a sanction for the refusal to work. They make a decision each time whether they’re going to consent to work or not, or eat, uh, or be put in isolation, right?"
John Oliver,"[John] Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. If the best defense for your business model is a hesitant comparison to slavery, you need a new business model."
John Oliver,"When a judge is likening your client’s practices to slavery, that’s generally a pretty bad sign for your case."
John Oliver,There really shouldn’t even be a verdict at that point—a trap door should just open up beneath you while they call the next case in.
John Oliver,And that’s not the only time detainees have been subjected to solitary confinement.
John Oliver,"One study found that over a five-year period, ICE facilities placed people in solitary 14,000 times, with an average duration of 27 days—well exceeding the 15-day threshold that human rights experts say constitutes torture."
John Oliver,"ICE itself reported that between 2017 and last year, at least 70 detained migrants died while in its custody."
John Oliver,And the details in some of these cases are horrifying.
John Oliver,Take Kamyar Samimi—he immigrated from Iran in the ’70s and became a lawful permanent resident.
John Oliver,"But while he was held in detention, the staff cut him off from the methadone he took to manage his drug addiction—completely cold turkey."
John Oliver,[Testimony] “I got a text from my coworker letting me know that an immigration officer had stopped by my place of work and had left a business card and wanted to speak with me.
John Oliver,"And he answered the phone and told me that my father had suffered cardiac arrest, that he was taken to a hospital, and then he was pronounced dead."
John Oliver,My dad died on Saturday… and I got the call on Monday.
John Oliver,I think it’s very strange that ICE observes business hours to tell people that their loved ones are dead.
John Oliver,Strange” is definitely one way to describe it.
John Oliver,"And incredibly, that story is not even a one-off."
John Oliver,One study found that 95% of deaths in ICE custody were preventable or possibly preventable if ICE had provided clinically appropriate medical care.
John Oliver,One of the cases it cites is a man from Angola who:
John Oliver,"The same one featured in that upbeat video about how, “Believe It or Not, We Care."
John Oliver,So I guess they mean that phrase in the exact same way Ripley’s Believe It or Not means it.
John Oliver,"Look, we’re completely full of sh*t. How you feel about it is really up to you."
John Oliver,"And if, after all of this, you are thinking:"
John Oliver,"Well, it sure seems like we’re doing an incredible amount of damage unnecessarily."
John Oliver,And don’t just take that from me—here is a former director of ICE basically saying the same thing:
John Oliver,We detain lots of people who are not dangerous and aren’t a flight risk.
John Oliver,"We should ask ourselves a larger question, which is: Why are we in this business?"
John Oliver,"And it’s just the politics of it, right? The public likes to hear ‘detention’—it sounds tough."
John Oliver,The public does love things that sound tough.
John Oliver,It’s probably why Mark Sinclair made his stage name Vin Diesel and not Regal Chucklewams III .
John Oliver,The very fact that this is a business is part of the answer.
John Oliver,And that is a fact not lost on some of those inside these facilities:
John Oliver,"[Testimony] “By keeping us here for seven or eight months, they are making money on us."
John Oliver,Immigration in this country is a business.
John Oliver,"Like any other for-profit endeavor in America, whether it’s:"
John Oliver,…I—I actually don’t have anything bad to say about Pottery Barn.
John Oliver,They make high-quality home goods at affordable prices.
John Oliver,"Keep doing what you’re doing, Pottery Barn."
John Oliver,But the thing is—everything I’ve shown you so far has been from before Trump took office for a second time.
John Oliver,What comes next will almost certainly be worse:
John Oliver,"Well, at the federal level, honestly… for the next few years, we’re f*ed**."
John Oliver,But some states have found ways to mitigate the harm:
John Oliver,I would argue all states should be doing that.
John Oliver,"And to its credit, New Mexico is considering a similar proposal right now."
John Oliver,"Look, Trump’s government is clearly going to do everything in its power to act as callously as possible for the next four years."
John Oliver,And I know no one wants to hear another heartfelt soliloquy about how this administration’s immigration policies fly in the face of America’s founding ideals.
John Oliver,"But moving forward, we’re going to have to find ways to push back—hard—at the state and local level against those determined to score political points at the expense of an incredibly vulnerable population."
John Oliver,"And to anyone who continues to support that agenda, there is really only one thing to say:"
Main Segment,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers Other segments: 2025 Donald Trump speech to a joint session of Congress, town hall meetings with members of the 119th United States Congress, and the Trump tariffs"
Reporter,Can you just tell us the numbers? How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally?
Press Secretary,"All of them. Because they illegally broke our nation’s laws and, therefore, they are criminals as far as this administration goes. I know the last administration didn’t see it that way, so it’s a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal. But that’s exactly what they are."
Luis,They asked us for documents. We showed them the asylum process forms—the court-stamped forms for us.
Judge,"I mean… yeah, it’s… I mean… slaves had a choice, right?"
