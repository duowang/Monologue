John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 12 Episode 15 Aired on June 15, 2025"
John Oliver,"John Oliver discusses how the U.S. incarcerates kids at a higher rate than other nations, the facilities those kids are being funneled into, and how John feels about word searches. Strongly. He feels strongly about word searches."
John Oliver,♪ (“LAST WEEK TONIGHT” THEME MUSIC PLAYS) ♪
John Oliver,"Welcome, welcome, welcome to “Last Week Tonight!” I’m John Oliver. Thanks for joining us. It’s been a busy week! Israel attacked iran, setting off a conflict that’s escalating as we speak, rfk replaced the cdc’s vaccine policy advisers, the pope wore a white sox cap, and in tennessee there was this major story: this morning, a zebra on the run and in the air. After more than a week on the loose in tennessee, ed the zebra was finally caught. Ed has been causing chaos and confusion in rutherford county since may 31st. Oh, no! But, after eight days on the lam, officials finally managed to catch the elusive equine. Deputies quickly hoisted ed into the helicopter harness before transporting him to a nearby animal trailer."
John Oliver,"Okay– there was a lot to love there. My only note is that, when you show footage of the world’s chillest zebra looking bored in a flying hammock, you don’t call that “being hoisted in a helicopter harness,” you call it what it is: “last week tonight bait.” And, in case it wasn’t clear, you got me. Because look at me right now! I’m squawking zebra news at you and disney isn’t even paying me to do it."
John Oliver,"And, look– I’d love nothing more than to spend the rest of the night exploring questions like, is this how animals are transported now? Getting hoisted like an adorable shipping container, while– and this is crucial– remaining upright like they’re sitting in a little chair?"
John Oliver,"But unfortunately we have to move on to a story that dominated this week: the protests against I.C.E. Enforcement raids. As you undoubtedly know, last weekend I.C.E. conducted sweeping raids across the country as part of an escalation ordered by stephen miller, a man who, despite all photographic evidence, is somehow still in his 30s."
John Oliver,"Miller reportedly told I.C.E. Officials to “just go out there and arrest illegal aliens,” suggesting they target home depots or 7-eleven convenience stores. So that’s what happened. And from the start it was a mess resulting in scenes like this in L.A.."
John Oliver,"We have obtained citizen app video from this morning showing multiple people getting detained by homeland security. It’s still unclear how many people were detained, and for what reason. The man says, “my friend started yelling ‘I.C.E., I.C.E., I.C.E.,’ And I thought he was joking, but he wasn’t. Then I saw all the day laborers start to run.'"
John Oliver,"That’s awful! Someone yelling “I.C.E.” is almost never going to be positive. Best case scenario, you’ve somehow time traveled to 2014 and have to do an I.C.E. bucket challenge. Something, by the way, this guy did, because he was nominated by– and this is true– “Mike Tyson, Vince McMahon, and Homer Simpson.” It was a simpler time. In response to raids like that, L.A. saw days of escalating protests, as community members rallied around their neighbors– something Trump seized upon as an opportunity to do this:"
John Oliver,"I’ve deployed thousands of national guard troops and hundreds of marines to protect federal law enforcement from the attacks of a vicious and violent mob. And some of the radical left, they say, “oh, that’s not nice.” Well, if we didn’t do it, there wouldn’t be a los angeles. It’d be burning today just like their houses were burning a number of months ago."
John Oliver,"Okay, I know I’m not saying anything new right now, but he is such a dick."
John Oliver,"There’s just no reason to bring up the traumatic fires that are still very much on people’s minds in L.A., for the same reason you shouldn’t open a toast at a retirement party with “wow, only milestone left after this is death.” Yeah, everyone knows that, and we’re all trying not to think about it. Also, it’s just so obvious when he stops reading and starts ad-libbing, as his tone of voice just completely changes. I honestly wonder if his speechwriters even write it in — if there are places where his teleprompter just says, “do a bitchy little vamp."
John Oliver,"A president sending in the national guard without the approval of a state’s governor hasn’t happened since 1965. And it wasn’t just Gavin Newsom who opposed it. The LAPD chief even said, “we’re nowhere near a level where we would be reaching out to the governor for national guard at this stage.” And for good reason, because, despite a lot of sensationalist news coverage, all of this was well within the city’s control. While scenes like this are being broadcast prominently around the world, here is some context."
John Oliver,"It’s all happening in a small part of downtown L.A.., at and around city hall and the federal building, where detainees from I.C.E. Raids have been taken just a few blocks in a county of nearly 10 million people.” Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass tells us the extra help is not welcome. When it comes to the national guard, you say they are underutilized, or just not working? I’m saying there is nothing for them to do."
John Oliver,"Right! And why would you send troops if there was nothing for them to do? You’re just gonna have 4,000 soldiers wandering around L.A., Swinging by the hollywood walk of fame to go, “huh, christian slater? Okay."
John Oliver,"Now, there was some sporadic vandalism and rock-throwing, and some Waymo cars were set on fire, but those were isolated incidents, not at all representative of the protests as a whole. And I’m not saying those visuals aren’t striking, I’m just saying setting a driverless car on fire is not the same thing as assaulting someone– unless we’re somehow living in the Pixar “cars” universe, where burning one is murder and you’d be condemned to hell by the car Pope– a real character from “Cars 2,” by the way, implying there’s car catholicism, car Jesus, and, presumably, a decades-long car cover-up of car sexual abuse."
John Oliver,"As for the people of L.A., they seemed pretty unfazed, with one writer saying, “I’d say the collateral damage ranks right above a typical Dodgers world series win.” And that sounds about right, especially considering, when the Dodgers won last year, fans literally burned a city bus."
John Oliver,"So the federal response felt completely over the top, especially when you consider troops will apparently be there for 60 days, at a cost to taxpayers of roughly $134 million. And usually, when that much is spent on something completely pointless, we at least get to see one of the Avengers in it."
John Oliver,"Honestly, much of the violence and unrest we’ve seen in L.A. actually came from the authorities. There’ve been multiple incidents of police abusing protestors. Members of the press were also assaulted, and at one point senator Alex Padilla was even forced to the ground and cuffed when he tried asking Kristi Noem a question at a press conference. And the fact the supposed peacekeepers were escalating the situation led to ironies like when Trump posted “arrest the people in face masks now,” and “what do these people have to hide, and why?” Which is pretty hard to take, given many of those in masks were I.C.E. agents themselves, something Trump border czar Tom Homan justified by saying, “they’re trying to protect themselves.” And, honestly, at this point, the only immigration official I really want to see wearing a mask is Tom Homan– and not to protect his identity, but just so I don’t have to look at his fucking face anymore."
John Oliver,He looks like Homer Simpson photoshopped as a real person. He looks like someone tried to carve Andre Agassi’s head into a bar of soap. He looks like baby Harvey Weinstein.
John Oliver,"Protestors this week showed admirable restraint. In fact, just watch this guy respond to getting teargassed with an almost annoying degree of L.A. chill."
John Oliver,"You told me you got caught up in the tear gas, as well. Describe what happened to you."
John Oliver,"Oh, just tasted a little tear gas. Tasted like fascism."
John Oliver,"Has there ever been anyone more “Los Angeles” than that man? Snarky attitude, sunglasses at night, beanie and sweatshirt in june, and a perfectly timed look to camera, all while looking like Travis Barker’s tether."
John Oliver,"And, look– who knows where all this is going? We’re taping on saturday, during Trump’s big military parade in D.C., and with mass demonstrations happening all over the country, so a lot could happen between now and when you see this. What I do feel comfortable saying is that, when everyone was warning about a slippery slope to authoritarianism under Trump– this is it. Because masked government agents grabbing people off the street and deporting them without due process is authoritarianism. Sending in the military to crack down on protests against those actions is authoritarianism."
John Oliver,"The good news is, polls show there is mounting public outrage over all this, as do the thousands of people in the streets this weekend. Even in word lawmakers were shot Saturday where lawmakers suggested it would be safer if people stayed away. People showed up in large numbers anyway, which is honestly the sort of thing that gives me real hope."
John Oliver,"We are living through a time in American history that will be remembered for acts of incredible cruelty, but I hope it will also be remembered for acts of courage and defiance. Think of this administration like a loose zebra in the suburbs. It shouldn’t be there. It makes you shout “oh, no!” A lot. Maybe if we all work hard enough we can contain it until the glorious day we get to watch it fly off into the fucking sunset."
John Oliver,"Our main story tonight concerns kids. You know– idiots. They don’t know important adult skills like how to do taxes, or have regrets. Which is why, for years now, local news has been full of dumb teen trends like these: they’re apparently bringing back the kool-aid man tiktok challenge that first started during the pandemic. Oh, no. If you don’t remember, it’s when teens mimic the commercial pretending to be the kool-aid man, saying “oh, yeah!” And then bursting through walls and fences. There’s another popular dare called the Kylie Jenner challenge, where the teens put their lips in shot glasses, they suck all the air out. It’s called the banana peel challenge. The challenge may seem harmless at first, but doctors say it could really lead to serious injuries. This tiktoker drank nothing but food coloring for 11 days, just to see what would happen. You may notice my skin is turning blue. It should come as no surprise that trying to turn yourself blue is not a good idea."
John Oliver,"Look– as far as experiments go, “drinking nothing but blue” probably isn’t going to win a nobel prize. Which is just as well, because we’d probably then have to watch a tiktok called “I ate my nobel prize just to see what would happen.” The point is, young people can do a lot of dumb shit, and that can sometimes lead to them getting in trouble with the law– something definitively covered by everyone’s favorite character, pants bear. Pants bear, where did you get the candy from? I don’t remember seeing that earlier. I– I– I forgot I got it from the candy aisle. But did we pay for it? Pants bear, you cannot simply take products from the supermarket. That’s stealing. I didn’t mean to steal it. Aah! Help! Oh, no!"
John Oliver,"For those unfamiliar, that is pants bear, a bear who– and this is true– wears pants."
John Oliver,"And say what you like about the Microsoft Paint quality of the animation, that clip falls under my single favorite genre of entertainment: british bears face carceral punishment. So it was always going to be a ten out of ten for me. But, the thing is, in the U.S., a kid ending up behind bars for accidentally pocketing a candy bar isn’t actually that much of a stretch. And that’s what our story’s about tonight– our juvenile justice system. We’ve occasionally touched on it before. You may remember, in our school police story we talked about kids winding up arrested for “crimes” like throwing skittles, or having a tantrum. That’s just one of the many ways for kids to fall into this system. And while it’s true that some have committed serious crimes, far more often they’re in trouble for things like vandalism, theft, or even so-called “status offenses” like truancy, or underage drinking. Basically, crimes that are only crimes if you’re a kid. You may have even seen stories like the one about the 6-year-old who went to court for picking a tulip from a yard at his bus stop. The point is, our juvenile courts are busy. In 2022, the most recent year for which data’s available, they heard just over 600,000 cases. That same year, over 130,000 kids were detained ahead of judgment, with an additional 38,000 locked up as a result of judges’ orders. The U.S. actually incarcerates youth at many times the rate of other nations. That’s from the “global study on children deprived of liberty,” which is not a study you want to be on the leaderboard of."
John Oliver,"It’s like hearing a urologist say, “single weirdest one I’ve ever seen!” That’s how ashamed we should be. A “topping the weird dicks list” level of shame."
John Oliver,"And, while we occasionally get glimpses of this system, it tends to be worryingly opaque. Juvenile court hearings are often closed to members of the public. Which makes sense, in a way– it’s important to protect kids’ privacy. But, in practice, that creates a dangerous lack of accountability for the adults in charge, because the truth is our juvenile justice system has many of the flaws of our adult one, except the people running it have even more power, and the damage it can do is even longer-lasting. So tonight we’re going to take a longer than usual look at two things: our juvenile justice system, and the facilities it can, far too often, funnel kids into. Let’s start with something that might seem obvious, but is still worth stating: kids are not, in fact, tiny adults. They are– and this is true– kids."
John Oliver,"And research shows that, in figuring out who they are and how they want to behave in life, kids often engage in exploratory, risk-taking behaviors that help them assess social, personal, and familial boundaries. Or, to put it another way: part of adolescence is testing the limits, and part of adolescence is not having the brain functioning to understand, “gee, if I do that, it’s going to get me in trouble."
John Oliver,"Right, kids are good at testing limits, and bad at weighing consequences. Sort of like a puppy, or a pre-iron man Robert Downey Jr."
John Oliver,"And we’ve long understood that kids need a system that takes their still-developing minds into account. It’s part of the reason why a separate court process was created for them back in 1899. And just watch this 1940s film, “Boy in Court,” which tells the story of a 15-year-old boy who helped steal a car:"
John Oliver,"Johnny and 200,000 other youngsters who are arrested each year are America’s number one crime problem. Can’t something be done to help these twisted young lives and set them straight? Yes, something can be done. Something is being done. Many communities believe that good juvenile courts with well-organized probation service can make good citizens out of wayward youth. Fortunately, Johnny lives in a community which has such a court."
John Oliver,"Yes, luckily Johnny lives in a community with a juvenile court, as opposed to the other kind of community, where wayward children are sent into… The maze."
John Oliver,"No judgment– both are good options, whether you’re talking about rehabilitation or… The maze."
John Oliver,"In that film, Johnny gets sentenced to probation, and his probation officer guides him toward youth sports, a process that all culminates in this happy scene:"
John Oliver,"Well, Johnny, mr. Benton tells me you don’t need probation anymore. You made good. I guess you won’t steal any more automobiles, will you? Gee, that was dumb, wasn’t it? It certainly was."
John Oliver,"Well, that’s nice. Although, is that kid actually reformed? Hair slicked back, sharp suit– he may have just been upgraded to a higher class of crime. “Stealing cars was a fool’s game, your honor. I won’t do that again, or my name isn’t little Bernard Madoff."
John Oliver,"But, obviously, court never worked that way for everyone, and definitely doesn’t for many kids today. One investigation into this system has likened it to plinko, the “price is right” game where a chip can fall any number of ways, depending on what it hits on the way down. And that’s basically true here– at every stage, factors beyond a kid’s control can propel them to vastly different outcomes. And, unfortunately, many kids have no idea how to navigate this system, or even what their basic rights are. For instance, if a young person is being interrogated by police, research shows they waive their miranda rights at extremely high rates, as high as 90%, and may not understand the consequences of that. Take this woman, who was arrested at 15 and unknowingly signed away her right to an attorney. She ended up getting sent to a youth facility, where she met another kid who’d been through the same court she had, and realized they’d both been denied something pretty important. I said to my friend, I said, “man, did you have, like, a lawyer?’ And she was like, “no, nobody has lawyers.” And I was like, “but haven’t you seen ‘law & order?’ Like, everybody has lawyers. Like, you’re supposed to have a lawyer. That’s what– if you don’t have a lawyer, you get one assigned to you. Isn’t that, like–” and she’s like, “I guess it doesn’t work that way for kids."
John Oliver,"That’s ridiculous. Every kid in court should at least have access to the stuff they have on “Law & Order,” which, as we all know, is… a lawyer. Two quippy detectives. A guy only loosely connected to the case, but played by a suspiciously high-profile guest star, so you know they did it. A dead body being played by a tisch graduate getting their big break. And, as always, an abrupt smash cut to the name– [“Law & Order” sound effect] exactly, you know, the usual. Now, without access to an attorney, she ended up being sentenced to three months in a youth facility, with six months probation, all for the crime of “harassment,” which, incredibly, consisted entirely of making this MySpace page mocking her school’s vice principal."
John Oliver,"And if you’re wondering how on earth a kid wound up getting locked up over that, it’s because the judge decided she should be. That’s the whole reason. Because, in most cases, when a kid goes to trial, there is no jury, meaning the judge has sole discretion in deciding the fate of that child. And, to be fair, some use that power judiciously, to dismiss or “divert” cases, which can take many forms, including writing an apology letter, doing community service, or participating in counseling or treatment for substance abuse. But judges can also go the other way– placing kids in a youth facility, or even kicking their case up to adult court. We do that to over 50,000 kids a year, which is actually down from its peak of 250,000 in the mid-’90s, when there was a lot of bullshit fearmongering about so-called teenage “super predators.” Back then, sending kids to adult court was actually a popular campaign promise for judges like this guy."
John Oliver,"As judge, if given the opportunity to try a juvenile offender as an adult, I will. If you’re a teen and convicted of murder, rape, or violent crimes against our children or the elderly, you can expect that I will impose the maximum sentence allowed by law. Mark Ciavarella, a judge to protect all of us."
John Oliver,"Okay, I have a lot of questions, starting with: what on earth is he walking in front of?"
John Oliver,"That setting doesn’t scream “I’m a noble warden of justice” as much as “my homemade ninja warrior training course fell down, so this is my backup career plan.” Ciavarella was the judge who sentenced that girl to three months behind bars over a MySpace page. And she wasn’t alone– over a 5-year period, he and another judge routinely committed juveniles to two private detention centers, in many cases giving out lengthy sentences for minor infractions. Which sounds bonkers, until you learn they allegedly received massive payouts from those centers, totaling over $2.7 million dollars. It’s a scandal that later became known as “kids for cash.” When it all came out, the outcry tended to focus on the “cash” part. But, to be clear, funneling kids into those facilities, even for free, is not okay, especially when you learn some of those minor infractions included smoking cigarettes on school property, opening a yo-yo in a convenience store, pranking a schoolteacher by hiding her purse, and stealing a hershey bar. Which, I’ll remind you, is the exact crime pants bear committed, and we all know what happened to him. Help! Oh, no!"
John Oliver,"Oh, yes, pants bear. In hindsight, you’re just lucky you didn’t get tried as an adult."
John Oliver,"And the fact judges have so much discretion means their individual biases can have a huge impact on sentencing. And one of the most glaring impacts is the racial disparities in who gets sentenced to what. 46% Of kids who get incarcerated are black, even though black kids comprise only about 15% of the nation’s youth. It’s a discrepancy this head of a new orleans juvenile center points out with heavy sarcasm. They’re all african american, black, young black kids. Today my population’s 100%, yesterday my population was 100%. My population is 100% most of the time that I’ve been here. We have an anomaly in orleans parish in that white kids don’t go to detention. Apparently, they don’t commit car burglaries. Apparently, they don’t get in school fights and commit assaults. Apparently, they’re not selling drugs, because if they are, they’re not winding up in detention."
John Oliver,"Okay, any time the population ends up 100% all one race, something’s up. That doesn’t happen by chance. Even at a black wedding, in a black church, somebody’s got a work friend."
John Oliver,"There are so many stories of kids who faced starkly different repercussions for the same activities. Take eric, a 13-year-old boy who was watching a movie and saw someone with a molotov cocktail. He thought it was “cool,” and wanted to see if he could make something that looked like that, so he grabbed an empty bottle and filled it with household products, then taped it up with black tape and put a piece of toilet paper under the cap– which, importantly, is not a molotov cocktail, just a bottle that looks like one. He left it in his backpack by mistake and brought it to school, where he was pulled out of class, questioned by police, arrested, and charged with possession of a molotov cocktail, which he didn’t have, attempted arson, which it couldn’t do, and carrying a dangerous weapon, which, again, it wasn’t. Eric is black. And when his lawyer told that story at a conference, a white woman walked over and said, “my son did exactly what you described,” though, crucially, he faced a very different punishment, as his school “rearranged his class schedule so he could take a chemistry course."
John Oliver,"And there’s just no clearer disparity in punishment than the one between “gets arrested” and “gets class credit.” And to see just how naked these differences can get, look at Rutherford county, Tennessee, where black children make up around 16% of the local population, but from 2010-2021 they accounted for 38% of those locked up by the county. At that rate, you’d almost think they were making up reasons to put black kids in detention. Well, guess what? All right, well, in Tennessee, a judge under fire for illegally jailing black kids for watching a fight back in 2016. The alleged crime– listen to this– criminal responsibility of conduct of another. One of the problems? That’s a fake law."
John Oliver,"Yeah! “Criminal responsibility for conduct of another” is not an actual charge, and you can’t just invent reasons to arrest people you don’t like. Personally, I’d love to put whoever thought a cologne should be sponsored by Johnny Depp in jail. You’ve chosen one of the only men on earth who looks like he constantly smells like feet and ayahuasca."
John Oliver,"That feels like a crime to me, but at least I acknowledge that it isn’t one. In the end, 11 elementary school children were arrested, and this all happened under a juvenile system run by judge Donna Scott Davenport, who had set up a process under which even kids accused of minor violations must be taken into custody and transported to jail. And, to hear her tell it, she was just doing what was necessary to stamp out a wave of youth crime, saying, “we are in a crisis with our children in Rutherford county, I’ve never seen it this bad,” and calling herself the “mother of the county.” And, I guess, in the sense that the queen from “Aliens” was a mother: sure. I’ll allow it."
John Oliver,"Davenport even had a radio segment where she’d talk about how she had no choice but to do what she was doing. I’ve locked up one 7-year-old in 13 years, and that was a heartbreak. But 8 and 9-year-olds, and older, are very common now."
John Oliver,"Okay. I am not a judge. I am not a criminologist. My expertise is mainly in sitting behind a desk, digesting lactose poorly, and telling you which of these guinea pigs can get it. From left to right: yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes. That’s a full house, ladies."
John Oliver,"But I’m confident in saying that, if putting 8 and 9-year-olds behind bars has become “very common” for you, maybe you’re the one who should be in fucking prison."
John Oliver,"The point is, which judge you get is one of the big variables in the Plinko Board of your case. The next is what sort of punishment you get, because if a judge doesn’t opt for leniency, they have a number of tools at their disposal, including putting you on probation– the thing little johnny got earlier. Some judges will give kids probation, either instead of locking them up, or for a time after. And, on its face, it sounds better– kids get to stay at home and, at least theoretically, get access to community-based support. But the terms can be so easy to violate, they can still end up behind bars for what amounts to standard teenage behavior. A few years ago, there was a case in michigan involving a young girl called Grace. She’d been sent before a judge for stealing at school and fighting with her mother, and was sentenced to, quote, “intensive probation,” which included a gps tether, regular check-ins with a court caseworker, counseling, no phone, and the use of a school laptop for educational purposes only. She was also required to do her schoolwork. But this was all happening at the start of covid and remote school, which, as we all know, was very difficult for some kids. Grace lost some of the support she’d been getting at school, and missed some assignments. Before long, she was handcuffed and locked up, because she hadn’t done her homework. The judge called her a threat to the community, a characterization Grace strongly disputes."
John Oliver,"Do you feel that at any point you’ve been a threat to the community? No, no, no, because if we called every person who’s taken something, or every person who’s got into an argument with their mom a threat to the community, like, I’m pretty sure everybody would be a threat to the community."
John Oliver,"Exactly, that clearly doesn’t make sense, because if she’d done her homework she wouldn’t have been considered a threat, but the second she missed a worksheet, suddenly she’s Tony fucking Montana."
John Oliver,"Studies have found juvenile probation is at best deeply ineffective, and at worst it leaves kids more likely to recidivate. And yet, the sad truth is it’s still preferable to the harsher alternatives. Which brings us to the second part of this story: youth incarceration. Essentially, locking kids up. That might mean a juvenile detention center where they await trial, like a jail, or a long-term facility after they’ve been sentenced, akin to a prison. But a lot of these facilities don’t like using terms like “jails” or “prisons,” preferring to go by “state schools,” or “academies,” or “youth centers.” But as this interview with the woman who oversaw this facility makes clear, those euphemisms aren’t fooling anyone actually inside one. Taylor calls itself a center. The state lists it as a correctional facility. The leadership calls the juveniles “clients,” not inmates. One of the young men I talked to today said, “they call us clients, but we’re not clients, we’re prisoners. You can call it whatever you want, you’re in a prison.” Does he have a point? Well, we do still control their movement. They are still certainly in an environment that we are in control, and that probably feels like prison. And you have barbed wire. Yes. And doors that lock. Yes. In front of you and behind you. Yes. One of the toughest things, for my job, certainly, is to always balance the needs of the client and public safety."
John Oliver,"Okay, putting aside the use of the word “client” there, it “probably feels like prison?” Yeah, of course it does! It’s fucking prison!"
John Oliver,"Lots of people feel like prisoners, but actually aren’t. You know– people trapped in loveless marriages, or a cameras-on work call, or a studio audience where the subject of the alleged comedy show is “kid prisons."
John Oliver,"But when there’s barbed wire and kids locked in a cell, it’s not just a feeling– it’s reality. Because whatever you call these facilities, once you’re inside, it is painfully clear what they are. From the outside, it looks like an office building, but go inside, it looks like a prison. These are single-occupancy cells, but look closer. This haunting picture shows who’s inside– children barely taller than door handles."
John Oliver,"Jesus Christ. And, honestly, props to that kid for turning the creepy factor up to a thousand."
John Oliver,"He saw someone with a camera and said, “let me show you assholes what it’s actually like in here.” Because that looks exactly like an adult prison, and typically we tend to try and tone things down if they’re designed for children. It’s the entire business model behind “kidz bop.” “Kidz bop” takes a lot of shit, but who else is changing the macklemore lyric in “thrift shop,” “probably should’ve washed this, smells like R. Kelly’s sheets,” to “probably should’ve washed this, smells like my baseball cleats?"
John Oliver,"No notes. 12 States have no minimum age to be sent to one of these facilities, and some others set the age at 7 or 8. Which is horrifying enough, even before you discover what it can be like inside them. Just listen to this mother describe the conditions of a facility her son was kept in, in michigan. They have flooding from sewage. My son literally called me and said, “ma, there’s literally poop–” I can’t say the word he said– “floating through the hallways.” Urine and feces."
John Oliver,"Look, I really appreciate that she’s going out of her way to be polite there, but if your child tells you they’re living in a state-sanctioned shit river, you should absolutely be allowed to curse on local news. In fact, it should be actively fucking encouraged."
John Oliver,"One employee at that facility even said, “I would sell my soul if it was my kid in there to get them out,” because the conditions are so bad. And while that facility’s since closed, there are stories of unsanitary conditions all over the country. The thing is, these places are supposed to be rehabilitative, but basic services like mental health counseling can be “non-existent.” It’s estimated that up to 70% of youths in the justice system have a diagnosable mental health problem, but as few as 20% of them ever receive mental health services in there. As for education services, they’re not much better. A child in south carolina reported receiving only a single day of education over the course of nine months. A lawyer in michigan said his her young clients didn’t have anything to write with to complete the schoolwork packets they were given, and a mother there said her son hadn’t been attending “school” at the facility, but instead had received a word search to complete. And clearly that’s not an adequate education. Though, for the record, that’s also the only time you’ll ever find me bad-mouthing word searches, because that shit is fun."
John Oliver,"A letter mystery where your eyes are the detective? Don’t mind if I do. I’m a word slut who loves to be right. Up, down, backwards, diagonal. It’s cirque de soleil for your mind. And when you find a word that’s not only diagonal, it’s backwards, honey?! Honey! Fuck me stupid, I’m wet for that."
John Oliver,"So it’s hardly surprising researchers have found that detained students have significantly worse academic outcomes, with one study in washington finding only 16% of detained students there graduated from high school, compared to 72% of non-detained students. And it’s not just lousy buildings or a lack of services– there’s also physical violence, sometimes actively encouraged by the staff. 30 Los Angeles county officers charged, accused of staging what prosecutors are calling “gladiator fights” inside a juvenile detention center, after video of one of those fights, first obtained and published by “The L.A. Times” last year, triggered an investigation. Parents of one of the teens speaking with nbc los angeles horrified with the footage. They say the guards appear to do nothing to help, even appearing to shake hands with one of the boys who hit him."
John Oliver,"Yeah, that’s horrifying. Even the roman emperor who invented gladiator fights, whoever that was, would look at that and go, “what the fuck is wrong with you? Also, how did you get it to be light in there without a fire? Also, what am I watching this on? But mostly, what the actual fuck is wrong with you?” And staff can be active participants in abuse. There have been multiple reports of staff at facilities doing things like withholding sanitary pads, or allegedly withholding prescribed medications as collective punishment. And I won’t even get into all the many examples of physical abuse we found researching this. Suffice to say, a guard at one facility in Florida apparently beat his detainees with with a broomstick he had nicknamed “broomie.” If all that wasn’t bad enough, which it very much is, some facilities also use solitary confinement– which, as we’ve discussed before, is widely considered torture. For kids and teenagers in particular, prolonged isolation can cause or exacerbate mental disabilities or other serious mental health problems. And yet, it’s been used routinely. There have been reports of kids kept in isolation for 22 hours a day or more, often for days, weeks, or even months on end. Just listen to this man who went through judge Davenport’s facility as a teenager explain how he wound up in solitary."
John Oliver,"Me and my best friend, we had gone out at night, and we had opened up some unlocked cars. They didn’t steal the cars, but they did take some change. It was a non-violent offense, but dylan was held in solitary confinement for four days waiting to see a judge. Four days doesn’t sound like a lot until there’s absolutely nothing to do. I mean, just go shut yourself in a closet for four days and you’ll know what I mean."
John Oliver,"Yeah, that would absolutely be torture. You try shutting yourself in a closet for four days, you’ll quickly lose your mind. Sure, you’ll maybe initially check the back to see if you’ve got any chance for a “narnia” situation. But even then, you’re dealing with some needy talking animals and some pretty heavy-handed christian allegory. You might be better off on your own. And, remember, that wasn’t even his punishment– he was just [laughter] waiting to be seen by a judge. This happens all the time. Though some facilities won’t use the term “solitary,” instead calling it “seclusion,” “isolation,” “segregation,” or “room confinement.” One even sent kids to what they called “reflection cottages,” which honestly sounds like a place on “the bachelor” where the contestants go to masturbate."
John Oliver,"And some facilities can be pretty shameless about this. Take the Richard L. Bean center in Knoxville. It’s known to lock kids alone in a cell more than any other facilities in their state. Here’s its head and namesake, richard bean, laying out his general philosophy when it comes to juvenile detention: used to be we’d paddle kids. 1986, we stopped when the state ruled you couldn’t, and had a lot of problems since then. We didn’t have any problems then. They thought I was about half crazy. I’d whip six or eight a year, and it run pretty smooth. What we do is treat everybody like they’re in here for murder. You don’t have any problems if you do that."
John Oliver,"You know what? I do have a problem, actually! And it’s not just that your name is “Dick Bean,” or that you have a literal kid jail named after you. It’s not even that you smack your lips like you’re recording asmr for sociopaths. It’s that you shouldn’t treat every child in your care like a murderer! And, for the record, most of the kids in Dick Bean’s facility are not yet convicted of anything! Most have only been charged with a crime and are awaiting court dates. And yet, kids have been put in solitary there for things like talking back and forgetting to bring their books to class. But when local news spoke to the center’s board chairman, he saw nothing wrong with what they were doing."
John Oliver,"It’s not like we’re putting them in a cage somewhere. They’re in their normal bedroom. It’s their bedroom. This is the solitary confinement. It’s just, you go to your room."
John Oliver,"What are you laughing at there, you deeply weird man? The only way that playful giggle makes any sense is if, just out of frame, a Keebler elf was tickling his balls with a feather."
John Oliver,"And while this is by no means the point, I just want to take a minute to address the episode of “Hoarders” happening behind this man. What is going on in that room?? I count four American flags, one aquarium for hanging dress shirts, two book ends with no books between them, a whole collection of elephants, one Trump doll, one Obama doll that either evens things out or makes things much worse, one etching of Richard Nixon, and one actual Richard fucking Bean! What are you doing back there, Dick? Sit anywhere else! You’re too old to be lurking in the background without suggesting some kind of “Weekend at Bernie’s” situation is happening."
John Oliver,"Tennessee’s department of children’s services has been documenting the improper use of seclusion at the Bean center for years, and yet they’ve continued to approve their license to operate. And while Richard Bean himself is finally retiring later this year, in the wake of yet another scandal at the facility, he’s doing so at age 84. And not only will the facility stay open, this deviled egg is still the head of the board there. And that’s the thing– nothing I’ve brought up tonight is new information. We’ve known about abuse in juvenile confinement facilities for decades, and it’s worth remembering that, if public safety is your priority, locking kids up by the hundreds of thousands just isn’t the answer to that. Detention actually increases the likelihood that youth will be arrested and punished later on. One study in Washington state found that every additional day spent in detention increased the odds of felony recidivism by one percentage point. Meaning that, locking kids up, over the long run, makes no fucking sense, as this critic of New Jersey’s system points out:"
John Oliver,"95% of kids who are locked up here are black. Brothers, you matter to us! Yeah, yeah! At a cost of more than $250,000 per kid, per year, more than an Ivy League education. Much more per year, much more than four years of an Ivy League education, and that youth coming out of these places reoffend at a rate that exceeds 80%. So we know we’re buying a whole lot of failure for a whole lot of money."
John Oliver,"Yeah– on top of everything else, this nightmare is not even cost effective! I can actually recommend a book that talks more about that. It’s called “the purely economic argument against ad hoc child torture, you know, if that’s something you needed."
John Oliver,"The truth is, we don’t do this because it works, because it doesn’t. We do this because we want to. Because we’re afraid of these kids, or mad at them, or we just can’t imagine that they could be ours, and so we don’t give a shit. There’s even a pervasive sense that, whatever happens to kids in these facilities, it’s somehow what they deserve– even if what happens to them is horrifying. Kids in Louisiana’s Ware Youth Center reported enduring, among many other terrible things, sexual abuse from guards as the price for phone privileges, or in exchange for food. Despite a horrendous pattern of abuse there, the D.A. had only prosecuted three guards in her 13 years in office, and, even then, gave them all plea bargains to keep them out of prison and off sex offender registries, because, she said, she “did not like the idea of burdening someone with a charge that they did not deserve."
John Oliver,"And when asked if the cases made her concerned about the safety of children at that facility, she responded, “we’re talking about armed robbers and murderers. And these girls haven’t even hit the age of 18 yet, some of them. Do I worry about their safety? No, I don’t. I think that they’re quite capable of taking care of themselves.” And it’s pretty telling who she’s comfortable reducing to a label there. “These murderers are fine on their own, but let’s not call these poor sex-offending guards ‘sex offenders.’ They have their whole life ahead of them!” “They can change!” That kind of indifference is sadly all too common throughout this system, and if you want to see the tragic consequences of it from start to finish, take the case of Solan Peterson , a 13-year-old who was arrested after an incident at his school. His parents asked that he go to a mental health facility, but instead he was sent to a juvenile detention center– as it happens, the same one where those guards were sexually abusing girls. While there, Solan disassembled the light in his cell and was sent to isolation. Under Louisiana state rules, isolation shouldn’t exceed four hours. Solan was kept in isolation for four days. At one point he reportedly told a guard that he wanted to die, to which the guard replied, “if you want to be killing yourself, just do it.” And I’ll let this news story pick things up from there. Solan took his own life in solitary confinement at the Ware youth center in Coushatta . The 13-year-old was there because he’d set a roll of toilet paper on fire at Haughton middle school. Solan’s death raised serious questions about whether he should have been sent to Ware in the first place. He had no criminal history, and was battling ptsd and adhd with the help of new medications. You know, we feel very confident in knowing that, if Solan had lived 15 miles in the opposite direction, that he would not have been in this situation, because the judge in that jurisdiction would have made a different choice for his case."
John Oliver,"Yeah, that’s heartbreaking. And yet, the Ware youth center remains open. And if you’re thinking, “how can a system treat kids like this?” I’d argue it’s what happens when too many of us stop thinking of them as kids. Some of whom may have done terrible things, many of whom haven’t, and none of whom deserve this. Because, look– we’ve all done stupid things in our youth. Maybe you shoplifted, or committed vandalism, or roasted a teacher online, or got in a fight, or, god forbid, opened a yo-yo in a convenience store– any of the things you’ve seen kids get in trouble for tonight. And maybe you didn’t face lasting consequences, but it’s worth remembering that, but for the variables of race, or class, or how the Plinko chip happened to fall, things could’ve ended very differently for you."
John Oliver,"So what can we do? Well, I’d argue the whole system I’ve shown you from start to finish needs reform. When it comes to the juvenile justice process, kids should be provided access to legal counsel at every step of the system. If they want to waive their right to an attorney, it should only be after a discussion with one. And if they’re going to be given probation, it should be designed in such a way that rewards and incentivizes good behavior, instead of penalizing a kid for every mistake they make. But, in general, experts suggest diverting kids into things like family-focused, multi-dimensional therapy models, mentorship programs, and investing in “community-based interventions” is, in most cases, the best approach. One of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken in this field followed over a thousand adolescent boys for five years after they’d been arrested for low-level offenses, and it found diversion isn’t just better for the kids– it actually promotes public safety through reducing violence, which serves everyone. The good news is there are lots of organizations that have been working hard to deliver those services. The bad news is they’re among the ones getting hardest hit by the Trump administration’s massive funding cuts. Now, when it comes to incarceration, I’ll concede there are some kids who may be a threat to themselves or others and may, for a time, need to be in a secure setting. But even then, I’d argue any residential treatment they get should bear no resemblance to adult incarceration. I’d also argue that adult incarceration should bear no resemblance to adult incarceration, but that’s for another time."
John Oliver,"That’s for another time. To their credit, all these states have passed some rules or statutes limiting the practice of locking kids up over minor probation violations, which is good. And all of these and D.C. have passed laws aimed at improving conditions in youth facilities, though I’ll warn you that cosmetic changes can be falsely reassuring. There have been numerous stories of facilities that bragged about new approaches like pet therapy and yoga, only for it to emerge that they were home to the same abuses as traditional facilities, just with slightly more brightly colored walls. So reform can’t be a discrete event– it needs to be a an ongoing commitment to oversee reimagine the system. And, for the final time, I get that some kids can commit heinous crimes, but our anger at those crimes shouldn’t be the main thing dictating our treatment of those kids, especially when you consider kids’ brains do change as they get older. Studies indicate that even psychopathic traits decrease with age in the majority of youth, whether they’re involved with the justice system or not. The point here is, no matter what they did, kids deserve safety, respect, protection, and the chance to grow beyond their mistakes. They deserve to be treated like individuals with potential and value, even– and, I’d argue, especially– on their worst days."
John Oliver,"Being an adult is hard. Becoming one is even harder. And we need to work as diligently as we can to make sure that we’re not wrecking kids’ lives by mindlessly throwing them into these prisons, or “academies,” or “youth centers,” or “freedom-challenged inside yards,” or whatever the fuck you want to call them. And if we can do this, then hopefully one day we’ll be able to look back on this absolute disgrace of a system as a thing of the past and, just like happy reformed johnny, say, “gee, that was dumb, wasn’t it?” And now, this. Announcer: and now, reporter ozzy mora loves to show, not tell. Think of social media being a tree like this one. Each branch representing a different platform. Las Vegas is one of the places with the highest eviction rates. Some of these rocks that you see here can be hidden around parks in trees, light poles, and tables."
John Oliver,"The ladies train 6-8 hours every weekend. Telling me the overall goal is to provide opportunities for women. Every licensed educator needs to renew their license 5-6 years, depending on their degree. This yoga course we are in right now offers six hours towards the 15 hours they need to renew. But when you open these doors, the opportunities are endless. It’s because students can end up in any decisions in class, whether it be connecting wires or cutting up some wood, or hammering away. The numbers show just how many students are struggling. For the school year 2022-2023, the department had 4,100 referrals from either parents or pediatricians. Speethirteen is not even halfway through the school year and there are already 2,000 referrals."
John Oliver,That’s our show. Thank you so much for watching. We will see you next week. Good night.
