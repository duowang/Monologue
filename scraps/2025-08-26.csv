John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 12 Episode Web exclusive Aired on August 25, 2025"
John Oliver,"John Oliver talks about Mike Lindell, the online marketplace that is his mesmerizingly bizarre version of Amazon dot com, and why you shouldn’t argue with the wind."
John Oliver,"Hi there, internet. I am John Oliver, host of Last Week Tonight, the only TV show that doesn’t know it’s a podcast yet."
John Oliver,"We are off this week, but I’m here because I wanted to talk to you about my store, the online marketplace started by deep breath. Recovering addict turned pillow magnate turned Trump acolyte turned election denied conspiracy theorist turned TV mogul Mike Lindell. Which before we go any further is simply too many things for one person to be. I am on my best day three things and that’s only if we allow that one of those things is tired."
John Oliver,"You are probably familiar with Mike Lindell’s My Pillow, but a few years ago, he expanded his empire, making this announcement:"
John Oliver,"Nowadays, it’s harder than ever to be an entrepreneur and make USA products. That’s why I launched mystore.com. Mystore.com is an online marketplace with thousands of incredible products that are personally vetted by my team."
John Oliver,"Yeah, my store is basically Mike Lindell’s Amazon.com, despite the fact that it looks like the website that filled your parents’ computer with viruses. If you haven’t visited my store before, first I get it. Honestly, I hadn’t until we stumbled across it while working on a piece about how Lindell was being sued by a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems for defamation. Sadly, we didn’t have time to talk about my store back then, but we do now because this is the internet where time doesn’t exist and no one can die."
John Oliver,"Now, much of my store is exactly what you’d expect. There’s Lindell’s flagship, My Pillows, and its brand extensions like My Coffee and My Cross, a necklace that’s currently 50% off with a promo code, meaning it costs roughly holy shit which is down from its normal price of go fuck yourself! But there’s also lots of other products that Lindell doesn’t make, but which have been, in his own words, vetted by his team. They’re not necessarily exclusive to my store, but he’s curated them with a careful eye. Products like make honey great again. basically a honey bear but with Trump’s face. Now, normally a 16oz jar of honey in a store costs between $5 and $12. But for just $22, which is in many ways more than 5 and 12, you can get it in a bottle shaped like our own smiling president."
John Oliver,But furious honey is just the beginning here. My store also features a bunch of alternative medicine adjacent products like this stay well copper thing that’s apparently the allnatural solution to killing bacteria and whose creator even made a special video for my store.
John Oliver,"I’ve become pretty crazy about finding an allnatural chemical-free way to kill germs. I created Staywell Copper which is antimicrobial copper made in the USA. It goes on the things we touch the most like our germy cell phones. Our mission is to keep you healthy in this germfilled time. So, be well and stay well."
John Oliver,"Okay, you too. Bye-bye. Now, now, as you can see, her product is basically a piece of copper that you stick on your phone to keep phone germs away. And it comes with a touch tool, basically a tube of copper to keep other germs away. And while the fine print on the site says it’s to be used in addition to handwashing, other images on it, like this one of someone rolling the tube on her hands with the text, “Roll between hands and fingers for safe, sanitized hands anytime.” Or this one that says, “Roll between hands and fingers to kill 99.97% of germs seem to have grabbed people’s attention more given customer testimonials like this one from Paddington that says, “The copper germ stopper looks like a pencil, although is much more. If I feel a sore throat coming, I suck on the stopper and voila, sore throat is gone. Which, oh no, Paddington. No sore throat very much not gone. In fact, I worry, sore throat coming, Paddington. Sore throat on its way!"
John Oliver,"But that is just the beginning of the products my store offers. There’s also the nautical twist utility hook, which really delivers on the hook promise without even sniffing at giving us something nautical. They also have incognitos, fire extinguishers with uniquely designed decorative covers. And who wouldn’t want that? Everyone knows when your kitchen is on fire. There’s just nothing more calming than figuring out which one of your weird patent bottles is actually lifesaving. Well, while we’re in the kitchen, they also sell something called the Wacker Spoon. Would you like to see it in action? Of course you would. And luckily they have a dramatic video showing exactly how to use it."
John Oliver,"That video is, and I promise it is true, 1 minute and 35 seconds long. And and I have to ask, given the expertly styled nails of the person using the wackers boo, did they hire a hand model for that? It’s a question that mostly exists to prompt the follow-up question, how does someone who has to write meat whacking video hand job only on their taxes explain that what they did wasn’t actually porn."
John Oliver,"Hi there. I know I understand there’s a product that’s got whack in the name and they’re using it to beat meat. You have to believe me that I know and you think that I’m better than making that joke, but the thing is I’m not. I I’m only human. I didn’t really want to make that joke or even hint at it. But some jokes are storms. You can’t get out of their way. You just have to let them run their course. You’re standing on the shore watching one off the coast heading straight for you. And there’s no maybe it won’t hit us. You’re not going to argue with the wind, are you? Show me someone who says I’m too sophisticated for a whacka spoon meatbeating joke and I’ll show you someone who debates storm clouds. I’ll show you a fool. So, I’m sorry, but I am not sorry. And I promise I will not do better in the future."
John Oliver,"Now, if you’re thinking, John, before we move on from the whacker spoon, I get that it can be used on meat, but can it be used on anything else? I’ve got some incredible news for you. Because it can."
John Oliver,"Yes. I mean, how else are you possibly going to crush a bag of nuts than with a whacker spoon? It cannot be done. Apparently, you can even use the whacker spoon for things you wouldn’t think it would be remotely helpful for, like this."
John Oliver,"It’s fantastic. And I do love that they included other fruits there because it did answer my one question, which was, “We’ve seen what it does to a lemon, but does it also not work for a lime?"
John Oliver,"MyStore also has you covered in case of sudden injury because it sells a product called Bleed Stop, which promises to stop bleeding instantly. And if that’s not your speed, how about bleed clot, which is basically bleed stop but horses. It’s the perfect gift for the one person in America who a has lots of pets indiscriminately bleeding. B wants to do something about that and C only trusts products backed by the most high-profile grift victim who hasn’t realized he’s being grifted yet."
John Oliver,"But the thing I actually most want to talk about tonight is actually you know what? I am sorry. I’m still hung up on Bleed Horse because I’m now obsessed with the kind of person who buys this product from my store. Honey, our horse is bleeding. What? What should we do? Quick, go to the My Pillow Guy store and see if he has anything for it. Are you there? No. I’m quite obviously googling divorced lawyers near me, you soft-headed idiot."
John Oliver,"Now, I will say some of MyStore’s products raise more questions than answers, like the extreme bucket or the various books that he hawks with titles like, “Hey, that’s my apple, the politically incorrect Jesus, and the government of heaven.” But I think the most inscrable product on sale at my store might be the amazing temporary tooth replacement kit complete with the incredible boast now with 25% more. More what? Tooth?"
John Oliver,But my true absolute favorite my store product is an item that I’m not even going to try and set up for you because I cannot do any better than this:
John Oliver,"Hello, I’m Glenn Seika, creator of Mutbuts Dog Toys. These patent pending dog toys are scented like a dog’s backside. But thank goodness humans can’t smell them. In my mind, I thought, why not make a toy scented like a dog’s backside? That seemed like a natural idea, being that dogs spend a lot of time sniffing each other’s butts."
John Oliver,"Yeah. Yeah, it is a natural idea. You’re completely right. And thank goodness humans can’t smell them. That would be weird. But Glenn will have you know, this wasn’t just guessing what a dog’s butt smells like and then replicating it inside a plush toy. No, no, no, no, no. This involved a serious commitment to the scientific process."
John Oliver,"After about a year of research, we were able to formulate synthetic versions of the organic compounds found in a dog’s backside and in an amount that is safe for dogs of any weight."
John Oliver,"Okay, that’s good. I mean, I I suppose it’s helpful that they volunteered that information as when purchasing a butthole flavored sack for my dog or whatever, I’m not sure I’d have thought to ask, “My dog’s a dashund. Is this amount of stink medically lethal?” Although, you know, at the risk of bringing everyone down, how did he arrive at that scientific conclusion? It is thorough research process to ascertain what is safe for dogs of any way to any point involve a pile of dogs physically knocked out by clinically dangerous amounts of asshole? I really hope not!"
John Oliver,"And I guess all of this really leads me to the main question that you’re probably all asking right now, which is: why? Why did I do this? Well, that’s a question that for what it’s worth, I don’t think was ever asked of the inventors of the meat beater, the non-pencil, or butthole bags. But it is one that I’m willing to answer nonetheless. And in many ways, I think I did this for no reason. But in some ways, I might have done it for the greatest reason of all because for all of Mike Lindell’s many, many, many, many, many faults. He is at the end of the day also weirdly inspiring. He’s the manifestation of the American dream that someone can overcome drug problems, pull himself up by his bootstraps, and undermine confidence in a national election, all while hawking some of the worst pillows in the history of humanity. And and it is Lindell’s tenacity that has led to him building a truly insane store that throws everything at the wall to see what sticks. And if I could take anything away from our experience of looking into MyStore, I guess it would be two things. One, Lindell’s blind optimism that drives him to take big swings. and two exactly $74.95 back because this, this right here just was worth it. I believe that I’m summing up both my purchase and the experience of our entire studio to say this was not worth the effort except you know what I actually think this works. Someone get me a fucking lime! That is it. Thank you so much for watching whatever this was. We’re back on September the 7th. See you then. Goodbye!"
