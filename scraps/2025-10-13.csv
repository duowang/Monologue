John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 12 Episode 26 Aired on October 12, 2025"
John Oliver,"John Oliver discusses the Paramount Skydance merger, how they’ve named Bari Weiss the new Editor-in-Chief of CBS News, and what her editorial history and perspective mean for the future of U.S. journalism. Plus, some notable moments in the history of the Upper West Side."
John Oliver,"We’re going to dive straight in with our main story tonight, which concerns CBS News — one of the most trusted names in American journalism. It gave us Edward R. Murrow’s Harvest of Shame , Walter Cronkite delivering the news of JFK’s assassination, and of course, this:"
John Oliver,"In recent months, a kind of underground fashion has spread among marijuana smokers. It involves the fancy paper used to roll the joints, as they’re sometimes called."
John Oliver,"Cigarette papers manufactured in this country, France, Mexico, and Spain now amount to big business, mainly because of the boom in grass, pot, tea, Mary Jane, reefer, giggle grass, or marijuana."
John Oliver,"Wow, someone really did their research into weed synonyms back then. I just wish he’d kept going: Giggler Grass, Boneweed, Power Flower, Magic Cabbage, Lucifer’s Lettuce, Smoky-Dokie, Whizzle Bizzle, and of course, Checking In at the Blitz Carlton."
John Oliver,"Specifically, we’re going to talk about CBS’s parent company, Paramount, and its recent merger with Skydance Media — a deal largely powered by the money of Larry Ellison, one of the richest men on Earth and a notable Trump supporter — with the company now run by his son David, a man with resting “just checked into the White Lotus ” face."
John Oliver,"There are already some worrying signs regarding what this takeover might mean for CBS News in particular, starting with the fact that this guy is thrilled about it:"
John Oliver,"[Trump] I think ABC is very bad. I think NBC is very bad, and CBS has a new owner. So we have hope for CBS. CBS has a great new owner, my opinion."
John Oliver,"Yeah, it is never a great sign when Donald Trump — seen here fresh from a trip to Sephora to color-match his hair to his skin — loves a management decision that you’ve made."
John Oliver,"But he does have a lot to be happy about. In order for Skydance to get its merger approved by Brendan Carr’s FCC, it committed to adopt measures that can root out the “bias that has undermined trust in the national news media.” One of those measures was installing this former conservative think-tank CEO as CBS News’s new ombudsman."
John Oliver,"But this Monday, Ellison took a much bigger step."
John Oliver,"A major shift in the landscape of TV news — Paramount Skydance announcing that they’ve made Bari Weiss editor-in-chief of CBS News and acquired her online news and commentary organization, The Free Press. She’s a registered independent who at one point called herself politically homeless, unrepresented by the two main U.S. parties."
John Oliver,"Okay, first — “politically homeless” sounds like how you’d describe Rudy Giuliani’s current fashion sense."
John Oliver,"Paramount has bought The Free Press for $150 million, and Bari Weiss, its co-founder, will now be setting the editorial strategy, vision, and focus for CBS Mornings , CBS Evening News , Face the Nation , and even 60 Minutes."
John Oliver,"Also, instead of reporting to the president of CBS News, Weiss will apparently report directly to David Ellison."
John Oliver,"And look, if you’re not familiar with Bari Weiss, you should know she’s a proud contrarian who, in public appearances, will inevitably deliver some version of this pitch:"
John Oliver,"[Bari Weiss] I confound people because I’m Jewish. I’ve always thought I was liberal. I’m gay. I’m married to a woman. Like, that’s my life. You would think that I’m liberal and I would just go along with the flow. It’s like, I look like them, I think like them, I eat at the same restaurants. But I don’t think all the same things, and I’m not scared to say when I disagree. And I think that’s really pissed people off throughout my career."
John Oliver,"Okay, first — and least importantly — the reboot of Between Two Ferns looks terrible."
John Oliver,"she’s a liberal who’s brave enough to disagree with other liberals. And along the way, she’s accumulated admirers from Jeff Bezos to Meghan McCain, and from Amy Coney Barrett to Joe Rogan."
John Oliver,"And if you’re thinking, “Wow, that’s not a very ideologically broad ‘from’ and ‘to,’” you’re starting to catch on — because there are times where she’s a little more explicit about what she believes, like when she gave a speech to the Conservative Federalist Society featuring this fun joke:"
John Oliver,"[Bari Weiss] I am a gay woman who is moderately pro-choice. I know that there are some people in this room who don’t believe that my marriage should have been legal, and that’s okay, because we’re all Americans who want lower taxes."
John Oliver,"Good one! And you can almost hear that room unclench after she basically says, “I know you think I deserve fewer rights, but don’t worry, besties — we’ll still chill."
John Oliver,"And while that is obviously framed as a joke, it’s also a setup to her saying, “In all seriousness, I am here because I know that in the fight for the West, who my allies really are."
John Oliver,"She goes on to say, “Among other things, the wave of so-called progressive prosecutors has proven to be an immensely bad thing for law and order."
John Oliver,"And I’ve got to say, for someone who claims they’re politically homeless, she sure seems awfully at home in that room."
John Oliver,"And look, this isn’t the first time an outsider billionaire has tried thumbing the scale of a news organization. We’ve seen Jeff Bezos increasingly meddle with The Washington Post , and Patrick Soon-Shiong do the same at The L.A. Times. But this feels like the most sweeping change yet — and at one of the few remaining prestige names in news."
John Oliver,"And if one person has suddenly been handed this much power over an entire news organization, it’s worth knowing who that one person is."
John Oliver,"So tonight, let’s take a look at Bari Weiss."
John Oliver,"Let’s start with the fact that she’s been given editorial control of a massive news organization even though she’s never run a TV network, has no experience directing television coverage, and — as one 60 Minutes producer pointed out — is not even a reporter."
John Oliver,"That’s true. She didn’t come up through the news side of a newspaper, but through the opinion pages — which are a very different thing. She really made a name for herself after being hired by the New York Times op-ed page in 2017. And to hear her tell it, it was for a pretty simple reason:"
John Oliver,"[Bari Weiss] To put it bluntly, I was brought in along with Bret Stephens from the Wall Street Journal as a kind of intellectual diversity hire. My job explicitly was to bring in voices that wouldn’t otherwise naturally appear in the New York Times — either because other editors wouldn’t think to commission them, or the writers themselves would think, “ The New York Times would never accept me."
John Oliver,"Yeah. She was apparently tasked with finding voices that the Times op-ed page would never accept — which is already a big claim, given that before she got hired there, it had published op-eds from, and this is true, Muammar Gaddafi and Vladimir Putin."
John Oliver,"If the Times had been around in the 15th century, I’m guessing it would’ve given an opinion piece to Vlad the Impaler: “Drinking the blood of my enemies isn’t disgusting — it’s beautiful and courageous."
John Oliver,"In any case, Weiss started getting attention at the Times for writing provocative pieces — like this one, in which she argued that the left had gone too far in policing cultural appropriation."
John Oliver,"This one — a largely sympathetic profile of the Intellectual Dark Web, a term that she popularized for people like Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro."
John Oliver,"And this one — suggesting progressives were so focused on labeling fellow Americans fascists that they missed opportunities to call out real fascism, which is just some weapons-grade whataboutism."
John Oliver,"That piece, by the way, also got attention for the fact that Weiss linked to posts from the “official Antifa Twitter account,” which was actually a well-known hoax site."
John Oliver,"Which is pretty embarrassing. You don’t expect a Times writer to fall for online hoaxes like she’s your 75-year-old aunt on Facebook who keeps posting that message saying, “I hereby state that I do not give my permission to use any of my personal data or photos."
John Oliver,"That is fake, Linda. Also, why would anybody steal your photos? You exclusively post pictures of your elderly cat. You’re going to be fine."
John Oliver,"But things came to a head in 2020, after the Times ran this infamous Tom Cotton op-ed in which he argued that the U.S. should send federal troops into cities to tamp down protests against police violence."
John Oliver,"A lot of staffers at the Times argued that it shouldn’t have published that editorial — and Bari Weiss wrote a series of tweets about a supposedly heated staff meeting, characterizing it as a civil war between “the mostly young wokes” and “the mostly 40-and-up liberals."
John Oliver,"That claim was strongly disputed by others at the paper, with one editor saying, “I’m in the same meeting that Bari appears to be live-tweeting. This is inaccurate in both characterizations. It’s not a civil war — it’s an editorial conversation, and it’s not breaking down along generational lines."
John Oliver,"So, to be fair, it seems Bari Weiss does have some reporting experience — specifically, trying to report what was happening in a meeting, only to have her own coworker say, “Hey, what the fuck are you talking about?"
John Oliver,"Shortly after that, she resigned, posting a lengthy resignation letter to her website, claiming that her foray into “wrongthink” had made her the subject of “constant bullying by colleagues who disagreed with my views."
John Oliver,She now tells the story of that letter in some pretty self-mythologizing terms:
John Oliver,"[Bari Weiss] I thought to myself, I have a choice to make. I can stay — and in where I lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Seinfeld territory — telling people you worked at The New York Times really meant something. It got you a good table at a good restaurant, among other things. And it meant a lot to me because I felt like, wow, I made it. Or I could leave, and give up the prestige, give up the platform, have no plan for what I’m doing next — but leave with my integrity. So I left with a resignation letter sort of heard around the world. It was my Jerry Maguire moment."
John Oliver,"Okay, self-aggrandizing bullshit aside, let’s not reduce the Upper West Side to just Seinfeld territory. It’s the site of many other cultural touchstones — like You’ve Got Mail , Will and Grace , and that time, the night before the Macy’s Parade, when balloon Spider-Man made an absolute meal out of Uncle Sam’s ass."
John Oliver,"Anyway, she quickly launched her own publication — first as a Substack called Common Sense , and later as a full-blown media company, The Free Press. Its first motto was “Honest news for sane people,” which feels scientifically engineered to trigger an eye roll."
John Oliver,"Here she is, not long after starting it, making her pitch:"
John Oliver,"[Bari Weiss] I want to create the media company where people can go for the best podcasts, the best reporting, the best analysis — basically combining the blue-chip, high-quality of the old media landscape with the punk energy of the new political realignment."
John Oliver,"Okay, first — it is pretty hard to claim you’ve got “punk energy” when you essentially spout conservative talking points while dressed like the front desk manager at a Courtyard Marriott."
John Oliver,"I, for one, do not trust the punk bona fides of anyone wearing an Ann Taylor Collus silk blouse."
John Oliver,"But it turns out, like most punk rock things, The Free Press was quickly bankrolled by a string of reactionary billionaires, like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and David Sacks."
John Oliver,"And in the five years since, it’s grown to roughly 1.5 million readers — although only around one in ten actually pay to subscribe — meaning it generates subscription revenues of about $15 million a year. Which isn’t nothing, but I would argue it’s also not quite enough to justify someone spending $150 million to acquire it, as that is a revenue-to-valuation ratio that would make Mr. Wonderful start vomiting blood."
John Oliver,"Anyway, Weiss has since stocked The Free Press with staffers who, in some cases, are quick to brag that — like her — they are proud refugees from the mainstream media:"
John Oliver,"Hey, I’m Lucy. I’m the social media editor here at The Free Press. And today I’m going to ask my co-workers the moment they realized they were free pressers. Olivia, when did you realize that you were a free presser? Um, when I was reporting for — [bleep] — on President Trump, and they inserted the word “racist” into the headline."
John Oliver,"Okay, so just to be clear, she was apparently reporting for NPR, even though that bleep makes it seem like she used to write for an outlet called The Fuck-Hole Times or something."
John Oliver,"And the word “racist” was atop a story of hers about public response to Trump saying that these four members of Congress — all American citizens, three of whom were born in the U.S. — should “go back to the countries they came from."
John Oliver,"And I guess, if you’re not ready to call that racist, The Free Press might be the place for you."
John Oliver,"One of Bari Weiss’s go-to lines is that she’s only interested in “the truth.” In announcing her decision to go to CBS this week, she said, “America cannot thrive without common facts, common truths, and a common reality."
John Oliver,"Which sounds great — but watch her articulate The Free Press’s approach to arriving at the truth, and see if you can spot a small problem with it:"
John Oliver,"[Bari Weiss] The identity of our brand is truth-seeking, and our premise is you cannot get to truth in an echo chamber. The only way that you get to truth is by sitting next to someone—this is what makes it so different from any newsroom I’ve ever worked in—"
John Oliver,[Bari Weiss] —sitting next to someone who disagrees with you…
John Oliver,[Bari Weiss] …and collaborate with them.
John Oliver,"Yeah. I mean, maybe that is how you do it as an opinion writer, but that is not how you get to truth as a reporter, is it? You do that by leaving the newsroom and reporting. That’s not saying, “The only way to hold Henry Kissinger’s skull in your hand is by sitting next to someone who disagrees with you.” No — that’s not it. You do that by leaving your desk, breaking into Dick Cheney’s house, going into his master bathroom, and taking it out of its jar."
John Oliver,"And I’ll be honest — there’s not a ton of hard journalism on The Free Press site. There’s really not much of anything there. There’s usually just a handful of new posts a day, which can even include weird editorial cartoons from David Mamet, the playwright. And if you’re thinking, “I didn’t realize David Mamet could draw,” fun fact: he can’t."
John Oliver,"But don’t worry, because that hasn’t stopped him from producing cartoons like this one that says, “What’s the best way to deal with detractors?” — with the answer being “A manual for tractors."
John Oliver,"Or this one, supposedly about environmentalism, that just says, “Shoving eggs up the tushies of chickens."
John Oliver,"Or this one, An Autobiography by Kermit the Frog , with a blurb that says “Ribbiting” — which I’m worried might actually be too funny."
John Oliver,"There are also a ton of first-person clickbait essays, with titles like:"
John Oliver,I Can Explain Why the Nazi Salute Is Back.
John Oliver,I Took Religion Out of Christmas. I Regret It.
John Oliver,I Want People to Have More Kids. Does That Make Me Far-Right?
John Oliver,I Was Called an Inbred Swine at Princeton Last Night.
John Oliver,I’m 17 and I’m Immunized from Woke Politics.
John Oliver,"My Family Was Hunted by Nazis, But I Was Fired for Defending Hitler."
John Oliver,My Husband Wants to Be Cremated. I’d Ignore His Dying Wish.
John Oliver,I Used to Hate Trump. Now I’m a MAGA Lefty.
John Oliver,"At this point, it feels like we’re just two weeks away from them posting an article titled, “I Dressed My Dead Wife Up as Hitler for Her Funeral, and Now Her Woke Family Is Mad at Me."
John Oliver,"And look, if you go to the homepage of The Free Press , it might not immediately read as a particularly conservative outlet. But once you start reading its articles, the pronounced theme that starts to emerge is “the left has gone too far.” Basically, whatever issue you feel like that’s true for — Israel, campus politics, DEI, or police reform — you’ll find articles there to reinforce that opinion."
John Oliver,"And look, I’m not saying the left never goes too far, or that it’s immune from criticism at all. But it can sometimes feel like The Free Press’s conclusions get out ahead of its evidence."
John Oliver,Which brings us to the fact that some of its pieces can be pretty poorly fact-checked — and in ways that feel important.
John Oliver,"First, take one of its biggest splashes: this article — “I Thought I Was Saving Trans Kids, Now I’m Blowing the Whistle."
John Oliver,"It’s an account by Jamie Reed, who’d worked as a caseworker at the Washington University Transgender Center. Her piece claimed that the clinic was harming patients by, among other things, routinely approving adolescents for medical transitions without proper mental health assessments, calling its work “morally and medically appalling."
John Oliver,"Now, that story understandably got a ton of attention — including from public officials — which prompted Weiss to go on Megyn Kelly’s podcast to take something of a victory lap:"
John Oliver,"[Bari Weiss] The day after the piece published, I’ve never seen such a sort of rapid reaction to a piece of journalism. Missouri’s Attorney General announced an investigation into the gender clinic. The reason that this story was especially important and gratifying for us to have substantiated was because it’s exactly the kind of story that we exist to pursue. It’s exactly the kind of morally knotty story that journalists avoid pursuing because they know they’ll be punished or smeared for doing so. That is why The Free Press exists."
John Oliver,"Wow, that is an exceptional amount of self-congratulation — and the bar was already set at the Jerry Maguire moment heard around the world."
John Oliver,"the state Attorney General apparently found that article, to borrow a term, ribbiting , because they soon announced an investigation into the center."
John Oliver,"It ultimately stopped treating minors, with Reed’s claims even being used to help justify a statewide ban on gender-affirming care for them."
John Oliver,"So, it did have real impact — which is what makes it so awkward that when Washington University conducted its own investigation, they found that allegations of substandard care causing adverse outcomes for patients at the center were unsubstantiated."
John Oliver,"And when other outlets reported the story out again and again, their findings did not match what The Free Press published."
John Oliver,"For instance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch found dozens of former patients and parents at the clinic who told them their experiences sharply contradicted the examples supplied by Reed."
John Oliver,NBC spent two months reaching out to nearly 40 people associated with the center and got the same result — with patients and parents saying the care they received was thorough and slow.
John Oliver,"And the Missouri Independent found parents who told them any treatments their kids received were only undertaken after long consultations with doctors and mental health professionals — and often, patients were told they needed to wait four years."
John Oliver,"In fact, at worst, follow-up reporting showed that as more patients sought care, the clinic became overwhelmed as its employees grappled with how best to help patients."
John Oliver,"And to be fair, the Times did find some former patients who had complaints, including one who’d since detransitioned and felt there’d been a major lack of care and consideration from the center."
John Oliver,"But even that article — which Weiss claimed vindicated their story — said it’s clear the clinic benefited many adolescents, with patients and parents saying their experiences were overwhelmingly positive."
John Oliver,"And the thing is, some of Reed’s marquee examples just don’t hold up on further inspection."
John Oliver,"For instance, she cited the harrowing story of a patient she claimed suffered liver toxicity from medication she was prescribed at the center, and whose mother was so distraught she sent a message saying they were lucky her family was not the type to sue."
John Oliver,"That sounds pretty striking. But when the Times spoke with that family, they were stunned to read this characterization of their daughter’s case — saying she only experienced liver problems after getting COVID and taking another drug with possible liver side effects."
John Oliver,"As for threatening a lawsuit, they were adamant that never happened — to the point they went on local news to refute the whole story:"
John Oliver,"You can’t see their faces — we’re in shadow, but we’re not hiding. But you can hear their voices."
John Oliver,"There’s lies, and people have paid for that in the transgender community."
John Oliver,"Did you ever say that you were going to sue the clinic, or ever allude to suing the clinic?"
John Oliver,The parents’ message goes on to say they don’t regret any decision and would never have denied their daughter these life-saving treatments.
John Oliver,We still have no regrets. It’s blatant exploitation of my daughter’s medical situation.
John Oliver,"Yeah, that mother felt that the story was blatant exploitation of her daughter’s medical situation — or, as I guess Bari would describe it, harnessing the punk energy of the new political realignment."
John Oliver,"And look, I get her frustration at seeing misinformation about her daughter go far and wide. In fact, when we reached out to that mother, she told us, “I’ve been fighting for the truth about that damn Free Press article for a while."
John Oliver,"And if you’re getting the sense that The Free Press isn’t about to let whatever fact-checking they do get in the way of a story they want to tell you, that also extends to some of the original reporting they do."
John Oliver,"Take this piece they published last year about Austin, claiming crime had soared there under a progressive DA named José Garza. It prominently featured a billionaire named Daniel Lubetzky, the founder of Kind Snacks, who’d moved to Austin a few years earlier and was supporting a primary campaign to elect a more moderate DA."
John Oliver,"The story claimed that Austin’s crime wave was leading many of its most buzzed-about new residents — and some of its wealthiest — to worry it might become the next San Francisco. But as local news there pointed out, there was a pretty big hole in that piece’s argument:"
John Oliver,"But this article from a website called The Free Press — one of the first lines (hopefully we can pop it up right here on the screen) — one of the first lines of the article claims crime in Austin has soared under a progressive district attorney. This morning, the numbers tell us that that is just not the case. We looked at crime reporting data from Austin police. So, in December of 2020, before José Garza took over, 20,500 crimes against people were committed throughout the entire year. A few years later, in 2023, with Garza as DA for a couple of years, the number was 2,000 fewer than in the same time frame."
John Oliver,"Yeah, it’s true. And it is kind of striking that even local news was like, “Girl, calm down.” Because the only thing they usually love more than overhyping crime is, maybe, dogs running 5Ks. This just in: woof woof pant pant — good boy goes fast."
John Oliver,"And finally, there’s this piece The Free Press recently posted about media coverage of young people starving in Gaza. It concerned photos that it said had helped convince a growing number of Americans that Israel has induced famine and is committing war crimes in Gaza."
John Oliver,"There is a lot wrong with this article. For one thing, it questions how starvation and famine have been measured by claiming the IPC — the international body that helps monitor food insecurity and malnutrition — has quietly changed its methodology in Gaza, essentially redefining the criteria for determining a famine."
John Oliver,"But that is false. Very basically, the IPC has multiple metrics for measuring malnutrition in children. One involves measuring height and weight; another involves arm circumference. Now, because arm circumference only requires a tape measure, it’s far easier to obtain, especially in a place like a war zone. So in Gaza, that is what they started using — because of, you know, all of this shit happening. And those methods were not, in fact, quietly introduced as The Free Press suggested, but have been accepted since 2019 and previously used in famine classifications in South Sudan and Sudan."
John Oliver,"But it gets even grosser, because the piece tries to provide extra context for some pictures of starving children. And here’s one of its writers — the one who used to work for the Fuck-Hole Times — summing her work up:"
John Oliver,"So, you’ve probably seen these photos of skeletal kids in Gaza on front pages, all over social media, even in a UNICEF ad. They’ve become the symbols of famine. But we decided to look into these photos and the stories behind them. And what we found is that in case after case, these kids were sick — but not just with malnutrition. In every instance they were suffering with other conditions or illnesses, like cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, and even traumatic head injuries."
John Oliver,"Now, their article claims all those kids were already facing grave situations because of their health irrespective of any third-party action. But a few things:"
John Oliver,"First, the traumatic head injury she mentioned was — as their article points out — caused by an Israeli shell explosion, which feels like a pretty significant third-party action."
John Oliver,"Second, it’s not like the twelve photos they chose to look into are the only ones illustrating stories about famine in Gaza."
John Oliver,"And as for the notion that this is something the mainstream media was ignoring, there is a key problem with that claim, too. See if you can spot it as she walks through their in-depth journalistic process:"
John Oliver,"We did something so simple, it’s shocking that no other journalist bothered to do it. So, this is how we figured this out. Let’s just take this example of Naja Hussein Haj, who appeared in CNN simply as suffering from severe malnutrition in Gaza City. So all we did is we took her name, we went to Google Translate, we took the Arabic spelling of her name, put that into Google, and pulled up a lot of local clips in which her parents were talking about what was really going on. And what we learned is that she has an esophagus condition — which is something that was even reported in English media, including The New York Times . That is a quite different and more nuanced story than the assumption that Israel wants her dead and they’re starving her."
John Oliver,"Okay, so if no other journalist bothered to do it, but it was even reported in The New York Times , that sure suggests the journalist very much did bother to do it."
John Oliver,"But also, if we’re talking about context — when it comes to the child she mentioned there, they quote from an Arabic news outlet. Here is the whole section about her from that outlet. Here’s the translation, and here’s the quote The Free Press pulled, mentioning her ailments since birth, including vomiting while eating. But it’s worth noting the sentence before says, “Her condition worsens each day without access to protein- and vitamin-rich foods that are needed for her treatment.” And the line after reads, “During the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip, her condition deteriorated and she developed malnutrition because the right food for her was simply unavailable."
John Oliver,"And while I would love to keep splitting hairs on whether a country’s starving kids is better or worse if those kids are already sick, let’s table that discussion for when I see you in hell!"
John Oliver,"That is not the only bit of cherry-picking in that piece, which features a lot of young people with, yes, pre-existing conditions or ailments that were made significantly worse when they couldn’t access food. And to be clear, as the president of Refugees International wrote, “People with underlying conditions always suffer first when hunger sets in,” adding that vulnerability is not a rebuttal of famine. It is a feature of how famine kills and who it hits first."
John Oliver,And it is kind of weird that nobody at The Free Press thought to include that sort of important context given that they are famously proud of their ability to Google shit!
John Oliver,"And you should also know that piece circulated far and wide among those seeking to downplay the suffering in Gaza — including Bibi Netanyahu himself, who shared that video on his social media with the caption, “Facts matter.” Which is terrible for multiple reasons, including: if Netanyahu ever shared one of our stories, I think I’d burn this place to the fucking ground! And by the way, any story — even the one where I ate the ass of a cake bear that looks like me — if he retweeted that with a comment, “Facts matter,” you would never hear from us ever again!"
John Oliver,"Everything I’ve shown you so far should comfortably be enough to make you question the wisdom of putting Bari Weiss in charge of CBS News. But I still haven’t even gotten to her weirdest venture, which lays out her priorities and worldview pretty clearly: she has started her own university. Specifically, she’s co-founded the University of Austin (UATX) in Texas, and it is exactly what you’d expect. Here is one of the school’s promo videos:"
John Oliver,"[Bari Weiss] If you’re wondering why the museums you love and the publishing houses you love and the newspapers you used to trust — if you want to understand why they are hollowed out, you have to look at the nucleation point for this, and that is the university. The premise is that America is not only not great but evil to the core and rotten and needs to be torn down. The answer to that is simply no."
John Oliver,"Okay, there are so many things wrong with that — from the firm “no,” to the bullshit straw-man argument, to the claim we all have publishing houses we love that have been hollowed out, to the pretentiousness of the word nucleation point , which sounds like the title of a straight-to-streaming action flop starring Steven Seagal."
John Oliver,"Now, UATX is currently unaccredited, and while Weiss proudly posted this image of students on the school’s first day, I should note that while that building does look impressive, that’s because it’s the Texas State Capitol. The actual school is housed on a couple of floors of a former department store in downtown Austin, which is pretty unusual. You don’t generally expect a college to suddenly pop up in an abandoned store like it’s a Spirit fucking Halloween!"
John Oliver,"While the school may not have a traditional campus, it does have a white-marble bust of Bari Weiss prominently displayed in one of its common areas. It was apparently donated by Joe Lonsdale, the billionaire co-founder of the defense contractor Palantir. He’s one of several billionaire donors to the school, along with Daniel Lubetzky (the Kind Snacks founder from that Austin crime-wave story) and Harlan Crow, famously Clarence Thomas’s benefactor."
John Oliver,"So the school’s already got a lot of red flags even before you get to what’s being taught there. Its Substack — because of course it has one — brags that it’s a place where students quote Joseph Conrad and Joe Rogan in the same breath. And one of its big selling points is that its students adhere to what’s called the Chatham House rule, which essentially requires all classroom conversations be conducted off the record."
John Oliver,I’ll let one of the school’s professors explain:
John Oliver,"If someone says something unacceptable to people or shocking or problematic, you can’t run out and say, “Bobby said something racist,” or “Susie actually is a Zionist.” You cannot do this. And what that means is students don’t have to conform. They can actually say what they think."
John Oliver,"Oh, that’s good. Well, in the spirit of saying what we think, I’ll go first: your vibe is all the way off. You look like Guillermo del Toro if he only directed episodes of Yellowstone . And you enunciate like you’re the third Crane brother that Frasier and Niles never talk about. And you can’t tell anyone I said that Chatham House rule!"
John Oliver,"If you’re wondering what sort of topics might require a rule like that, apparently one of their first offerings were summer classes called “The Forbidden Courses,” which promised to inquire honestly into today’s most vexing questions — illustrated with a photo of an instructor apparently pointing out hot-button statements for debate. If you zoom in, you’ll see it: “Non-Black people cannot use the n-word.” And suddenly that Chatham House rule makes a whole lot of sense, doesn’t it? Although any Black college student will tell you you don’t need to set up a whole university to find out which college kids are comfortable using the n-word — all it takes is a couple of rum-and-cokes and Lil Wayne on shuffle."
John Oliver,"Look, it is no mystery what sort of person starts a university like this. But in case there were any doubt at all, just listen to Bari Weiss — not long after campus protests started over Gaza — spell out as clearly as possible what she wanted to see happen:"
John Oliver,"[Bari Weiss] Above all, starting today, we need to uproot, root and branch, the ideology that has supplanted truth at the core of American higher education. And that ideology goes by the name DEI. Some call it “wokeness,” or “anti-racism,” or “progressivism,” or “safety,” or “critical social justice,” or “identity Marxism.” Whatever term you use, what is clear is that this worldview has gained power in the world in a conceptual instrument called DEI."
John Oliver,"Yeah. And that itself is a whole worldview right there. You know — this DEI thing that we’ve been trying, where we acknowledge not everyone’s been getting equal access to opportunity? Let’s just roll back the clock on that, shall we?"
John Oliver,"Also, let’s be anti-anti-racist and not think too much about what that might make us."
John Oliver,"DEI is actually one of her favorite targets. She’s also said it’s undermining America , that it’s about arrogating power , and that it demonizes hard work, merit, family, and the dignity of the individual."
John Oliver,"And look — it is not new, or indeed interesting, that a commentator would say that. There are plenty of them out there, and there will always be an audience for those who want to make that case."
John Oliver,"And the truth is, we wouldn’t even have done this story were it not for the fact that Bari Weiss has just been named editor-in-chief of CBS News. And that feels different."
John Oliver,"Because there are many opinion-heavy outlets out there — from left to right, and with low to high editorial standards. This show is, among other things, an opinion outlet. And while our staff works incredibly hard to research stories before we write something, and vigorously check our facts afterward, we’re also not the news."
John Oliver,"And I wouldn’t want anyone who led a pure opinion outlet — not even one that I happen to agree with — to suddenly be running CBS News. But it’s especially alarming to have someone doing it who has spent years putting out work that, in my opinion, is at best irresponsible and at worst deeply misleading."
John Oliver,"And look, it’s not just about Bari Weiss being at CBS. It’s about the fact that CBS is now under the control of someone who thinks that she, and her editorial sensibility, make her a good fit for the job — and who, incidentally, is reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, home of CNN and, uh-oh, HBO. Which isn’t ideal."
John Oliver,"Although, I’ve got to say — if what he likes about Bari is that she forces him to have hard conversations that get a bit uncomfortable — maybe he’ll like this."
John Oliver,"But the thing is, it’s not just about Ellison either. Again, he’s just the latest in a string of billionaires who’ve taken over our journalistic institutions — from The Washington Post to The L.A. Times — and started making worrying changes."
John Oliver,And whatever complaints I might have had with their coverage before — and I have had plenty — my solution would never have been this.
John Oliver,"Because when these takeovers get announced, it’s easy to think, “Well, thank goodness there are other outlets that aren’t under some billionaire’s influence."
John Oliver,That’s true — because there’s always another one. Until there suddenly isn’t.
John Oliver,"And I admit, I don’t know what’s going to happen next. Maybe Bari Weiss will completely reshape CBS News. Maybe she’ll flame out and write another resignation letter heard around the world."
John Oliver,"But it’s worth keeping an eye out for subtle changes there. Because while I’m sure many of CBS’s good journalists will continue to do great work, if you start seeing people resigning or getting fired — or you start seeing stories that seem off in some way, especially if they involve “the left going too far” on a topic Bari Weiss cares about — it’s worth asking yourself why that might be."
John Oliver,"Because unfortunately, the much bigger answer might be that a billionaire has chosen to inject contrarian, right-leaning opinion journalism into an American icon — even if, much like that Thanksgiving Day Spider-Man, it has absolutely no fucking business being there."
