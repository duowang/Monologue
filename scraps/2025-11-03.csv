John Oliver,"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Season 12 Episode 28 Aired on November 2, 2025"
John Oliver,"John Oliver discusses the prevalence of police chases, why the risks involved can massively outweigh the benefits, and why everyone with a broken taillight needs to go get their laundry out of the dryer. Seriously, stop reading this and go get your clothes. They’ve been in there for days. We’re trying to help you."
John Oliver,"Our main story tonight concerns police chases. They’re famously a staple of action movies and cop shows, a time filler on local news, and also the subject of a series of late ’90s TV specials, VHS tapes, and a spin-off show hosted by former Sheriff John Bernell, a man with a flair for the dramatic."
John Oliver,"Some crooks think a motorcycle is the ultimate escape vehicle. But when it comes to winning pursuits, any cop will tell you it’s not what you drive, it’s how you drive."
John Oliver,"When an angry driver takes his personal problems on the road, it’s called road rage. It can turn a normal person into a violent criminal."
John Oliver,"Drunks don’t know when to stop drinking, and drunk drivers don’t know when to stop driving."
John Oliver,"The weather can be the deciding factor in a pursuit. When it’s good, we take it for granted. But when it’s bad, it could mean disaster."
John Oliver,"So, buckle up. In the next hour, you’ll see some of the most terrifying moments police cameras have ever captured."
John Oliver,"So, buckle up. This is your first-class ticket to high-speed action, and you’re in the driver’s seat."
John Oliver,But hold on. You’re not even in the driver’s seat. You haven’t been the whole time.
John Oliver,"Still, say what you will about John Bernell, like that he delivers lines with the subtlety of a community theater actor’s understudy while dressed like the star of a Cialis commercial. He is right to imply that police chases can be dangerous. And for a long time, we didn’t know exactly how dangerous because the federal government doesn’t reliably track deaths from them."
John Oliver,"But when the San Francisco Chronicle recently compiled their own database, they found that over a six-year period, more than 3,300 people died nationwide in police pursuits. That’s an average of nearly two a day. On top of which, a majority of those killed weren’t even the fleeing drivers, with over 500 of the victims being innocent bystanders. All of which is probably why a DOJ report once called high-speed chases possibly the most dangerous of all ordinary police activities, with a former sheriff describing them as like firing a 4,000-pound bullet down the street — a visual that I’m pretty sure just gave Wayne LaPierre a life-threatening boner."
John Oliver,"And the thing is, even when chases don’t end tragically, they can still do a ton of damage, as this man experienced last year."
John Oliver,A car being chased by West Memphis police hit this man’s home in South Memphis on Halloween.
John Oliver,Why would y’all come over here chasing somebody and then he hits an innocent bystander’s house? I’m off because I feel like they did not go through protocol and they need to keep that over there.
John Oliver,"Yeah, he’s completely right there, because you expect to see certain things in a front yard on Halloween: pumpkins, fake cobwebs, one of those towering skeleton decorations that looks like Jacob Elordi got electrocuted — but not a car wreck caused by a police chase."
John Oliver,"And while fleeing drivers are usually depicted in movies and TV shows as violent criminals, in real life that is rarely the case. Researchers found roughly 90% of pursuits are initiated because of traffic violations. And the reasons people tend to flee are often relatively mundane — from their license being suspended to being on probation to simply saying they feared the police. And this combination of high-stakes chases over low-stakes infractions has resulted in situations like this totally preventable tragedy in Georgia."
John Oliver,Larry Turner still can’t believe his best friend of 30 years is gone. “I lost my brother.” Sixty-year-old William Johnson was killed Sunday just before noon as he waited on a red light at McAfee and Candler. That’s when this speeding SUV came out of nowhere and crashed into him. Turner was floored when he learned a Georgia state trooper was chasing the driver of the SUV for a seat belt violation. “It’s just not worth losing a life or even being injured. It’s just not worth it over a seat belt.
John Oliver,"Exactly. Because that is absurd. The whole point of a seat belt law was to keep people safe on the road. So, it’s more than a little counterproductive to then enforce it by turning the road into a fucking NASCAR track."
John Oliver,"And that is not a one-off. Of the fatal chases the Chronicle was able to review in depth, over 1,500 people died in pursuits initiated over traffic infractions, non-violent crimes, or indeed no crime at all. In fact, people have died in chases that started with attempted police stops for things as petty as having tinted windows or a broken tail light — which is just ridiculous, because someone who hasn’t gotten around to fixing their tail light doesn’t deserve to be dangerously chased by the police. What they deserve is an ADHD diagnosis."
John Oliver,"In fact, if anyone with a broken tail light is watching this show right now, I have an important message for you: You have clothes in the dryer. They’ve been in there for days. Get them out."
John Oliver,"So, given all of that, tonight, let’s talk about police chases — why they happen, and why the risks involved can massively outweigh the benefits."
John Oliver,"And let’s start with the fact that police have been chasing cars basically since they were first invented. One of the first reported chases was in St. Louis in 1906, when a driver was pursued by what were delightfully known as “scadoodle cops.” Chases soon became prevalent across the country but started getting a lot more attention in the ’90s, in large part thanks to this:"
John Oliver,"Pursuits really became a thing with O.J. Simpson. He’s in the driver’s seat. We’ve received a report of a gun in the car.” “They predated O.J., but that kind of elevated the pursuit to something much larger.” “All I did was love Nicole. That’s all I did was love her.” That was the one that made everyone realize — wow, this is like this incredible spectator sport."
John Oliver,"Yeah. The O.J. chase was one of those jaw-dropping moments in the history of TV — right up there with the moon landing, Nixon’s resignation, and that time the Today Show anchors tried to dress up as the characters from the Peanuts comics and ended up looking like something from your darkest nightmares."
John Oliver,"The O.J. chase attracted around 95 million viewers, ushering in a new era of police chases becoming entertainment. For a while, one officer in California even ran a paid service that alerted subscribers when a live pursuit was on TV."
John Oliver,"And people still love watching them. In 2023, Pluto TV launched a 24-hour chase channel — which sounds about right, doesn’t it? The sentence Pluto TV launched a 24-hour police chase channel is the exact type of depressingly accurate nonsense sentence that just permeates our world right now. You know, like “the Hawk Tuah girl was in the pilot of Chad Powers on Hulu,” or “Jimmy Fallon and Malala did ‘Bees in the Trap’ on TikTok.” If you’d said those words to me 20 years ago, I’d have thought I was having a stroke."
John Oliver,"And sometimes, even the participants in a chase seem to realize that they’re part of a media event."
John Oliver,"Last year, there was a crazy pursuit. “These guys were doing donuts on Hollywood Boulevard.” “Oh, they’re just trying to have a good time right now.” “What?” And then they ended up going by restaurants where people were watching it in a bar, and people would run out on the sidewalk and cheer them on as they were going. [Applause] “And a TMZ tour bus tried to stop them on the freeway.” “Oh, are they going to stop it?” And one of the guys threw a sandwich at the TMZ bus. “How’s this for an only-in-L.A. moment? It doesn’t get more Hollywood than that."
John Oliver,"Okay, first — regarding the donuts, hell yeah. And two, I would say that’s the most messed-up thing TMZ has ever done. But remember, it did publish the headline Jerry Sandusky Feasting on Wieners Behind Bars. So, let’s call it a close second."
John Oliver,"But obviously, chases don’t just take place in L.A. They happen all over the country. And that brings us to an important point — depending on where you live, the policies governing them can vary widely."
John Oliver,"There are no mandated national standards. So, in general, the nearly 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. set their own chase policies. Some only allow officers to pursue suspects for serious crimes."
John Oliver,"For instance, one department in Minnesota even created this helpful acronym:"
John Oliver,"S.H.A.R.K helps officers determine when to pursue. The acronym details the crimes where officers can continue chasing a fleeing car if they know the person driving it is wanted for Sexual assault with a weapon, Homicide, Assault in the first or second degree, Aggravated robbery, or Kidnapping."
John Oliver,"Yeah, that’s a pretty good acronym, isn’t it? And how excited were they when they realized they could write “aggravated robbery” as “robbery aggravated only”? Just hours of people trying to make “SHAK” work before one genius changed everything."
John Oliver,"But other departments give officers more leeway to chase people for non-violent offenses like stolen cars and drug-related crime, while others give even broader discretion."
John Oliver,"The Georgia State Patrol, for instance, doesn’t restrict pursuits at any speed, under any weather or traffic conditions, or for any charge — which probably explains why people died in Georgia more often as a result of police pursuits than in any other state."
John Oliver,"And in many places, police are allowed to make chases even riskier by conducting what’s known as a PIT maneuver — or Precision Immobilization Technique. It was adapted from a tactic in stock car racing known as the bump and run, which I know sounds like a hazardous sex position that’s essentially just doggy style on a moving treadmill."
John Oliver,"But it is actually when the police use their vehicle to intentionally make contact with the rear side panel of a fleeing car, causing it to lose traction and spin out. It is incredibly dangerous, especially at higher speeds, when it can cause vehicles to roll over, greatly increasing the likelihood of injury or death."
John Oliver,Which is what makes it so incredible that some police departments have put out videos of their officers excitedly talking about how fun it is to train on the procedure.
John Oliver,"You hear that? That’s the sound of a good day. Today I got the opportunity to train with some of our patrol deputies on the emergency vehicle operations course — the PIT maneuver. By far one of my favorite things, just getting up next to the bad guy and making him pull over. It’s so much fun."
John Oliver,"Cool. And look, to be fair, calling spinning a car out “so much fun” does make total sense if what you’re doing is playing Mario Kart. But in real life, it’s worth remembering there’s going to be an actual person in that bad guy’s car — and not a cartoon sex criminal."
John Oliver,"But while PIT maneuvers are sometimes presented as a way to safely bring a pursuit to an end, reporters have found that since 2017, at least 87 people across the country have been killed by them — including 37 people who were passengers or bystanders, and seven children. And that is likely an undercount."
John Oliver,"And yet, some departments seem to PIT cars at the slightest provocation. Take this investigation into the practice in Arkansas:"
John Oliver,"In the past four years, state police attempted to or pitted drivers at least 306 times. Almost half of those were last year. Records show many started as minor traffic violations."
John Oliver,"That’s what happened here, when Senior Corporal Rodney Dunn said he clocked a driver speeding. His dash cam video shows the SUV slowed down and flashed hazards. He followed for three minutes, then pitted the SUV, which caused it to spin into a concrete barrier and flip. The video kept rolling as the driver, who was pregnant, explained why she didn’t stop."
John Oliver,I just didn’t feel like the shoulder was big enough.
John Oliver,What happens when people don’t stop for us?
John Oliver,It’s true — the officer pitted her car while she was looking for a safe place to pull over. And how does that keep anyone safe?
John Oliver,"Well, they were trying to save Balloon Boy. They didn’t shoot him out of the sky, did they? Now, did they consider it? Almost definitely. No way was it never on the table. But they didn’t — and in the end, it didn’t matter, because the boy was never in the balloon."
John Oliver,"History should have ended there. And look, you should know the official Arkansas driver’s license study guide back then literally said that when being pulled over, you should activate your turn signal or emergency flashers to indicate that you’re seeking a safe place to stop. So, she seemed to be following the guidelines perfectly there. And when you follow the rules, you generally don’t expect your car to wind up on the side of the highway doing a fucking headstand!"
John Oliver,"The point is, the dangers you can face from police chases depend heavily on where you are. But they can also depend on who you are. Because unsurprisingly, some are more at risk than others. While Black people account for roughly one-eighth of the U.S. population, they make up more than a third of fatalities caused by police pursuits and account for upwards of a quarter of the bystanders killed as a result of them."
John Oliver,"And this is for many reasons — from fear of police, to racial profiling, to the problematic level of traffic enforcement in Black neighborhoods. That’s actually something that we discussed in our episode on traffic stops — an episode that ended, and this is true, like this. And you are just going to have to trust me that it made sense at the time."
John Oliver,"And frustratingly, we’ve known about this for a while. The problems with police chases have been discussed extensively over the years. Experts say that, as in so many areas of policing, policies around chases are subject to a pendulum effect — moving in one direction or the other depending on public opinion, police leadership, or politics."
John Oliver,"In Milwaukee, for instance, after the deaths of four innocent bystanders from police vehicle pursuits, they adopted a new policy in 2009 basically limiting police to only chasing in the event of a violent felony. But over the years, for a variety of reasons, those rules got loosened — first to allow officers to pursue carjacked vehicles, then to allow pursuits in reckless driving cases, or when a car was linked to drug dealing. And in that time, the city saw a twentyfold surge of police chases. And unsurprisingly, as the number of pursuits increased, the number of injuries and deaths did as well."
John Oliver,"And of course, they did. If you have more of one, you’re going to have more of the other. It’s like how when the number of Ryan Murphy shows increased, so did the number of Sarah Paulson wigs. It’s basic cause and effect."
John Oliver,"And while cops often argue that restricting chases means more people will flee them and that crime will increase, experts have called that a myth, saying research suggests that if police did not chase offenders, there would be no significant increase in the number of suspects who flee, and pointing out that agencies with more restrictive pursuit policies do not have higher crime rates."
John Oliver,"And it is worth remembering that, especially when it comes to minor traffic offenses, cops do have other tools at their disposal to bring someone to justice. Just watch as a reporter asks a criminal justice professor — a former cop, by the way — to explain why it might be okay to let someone drive away."
John Oliver,"Yeah, you don’t always need to chase someone, especially when the police have an absolute mountain of surveillance tech at their disposal — which is, spoiler alert, a future story we’ve got planned for this show. We’ve actually got a bunch of fun stories in the pipeline for you: police surveillance tech, Trump versus the Sun, and Graves — what they are, why they’re not what you think, and what the government can do to stop all the sex on top of them."
John Oliver,"And look, I do get that police can be infuriated seeing someone drive away. It is what’s simmering just beneath the surface of this indignant John Bernell walk-and-talk in one of his many police chase specials."
John Oliver,"Okay, first — keeping all those people safe is quite literally a police officer’s job. Let’s not complain about doing the bare minimum here. But second, it is so hard to take anything that man says seriously because I’m always expecting him to motion to his right and start selling portable rotisserie cookers."
John Oliver,"And the thing is, as this professor who has studied chases for decades points out, it’s not unreasonable to expect the police to be the more responsible party."
John Oliver,"Yeah, weird zoom into his face aside there, that man is right. When you’re a police officer, being the adult in the room is kind of your job. That’s honestly true for anyone whose job involves dealing with the public. Calming things down is basically 50% of the job of a police officer, 70% of the job of a Target cashier, and 100% of the job of a Waffle House employee."
John Oliver,"Listen, listen. We’re all here for the same reasons. So, let’s just focus on what unites us here. We all love breakfast, and none of us are allowed in an IHOP. Everybody chill the fuck out!"
John Oliver,"But too often, police will give chase when the threat to public safety is minimal, and then when something goes wrong, simply blame the person they were pursuing. Just watch a sheriff in South Carolina blow off some basic questions about the death of a teenage boy in a chase that began over a traffic stop."
John Oliver,"Right. We don’t know. It’s one of many things we don’t know — including, what the fuck is going on next to that man? What is that thing? Is it a Halloween decoration? I sure hope so, because my second guess is an American Girl doll who joined the Klan. And my third is a voodoo doll holding a string of anal beads."
John Oliver,"And even when a police chase injures a bystander, cops can refuse to take any blame. Take this story from last year of a woman who sued a Michigan police department, claiming officers engaged in negligence and reckless conduct during a pursuit that seriously hurt her."
John Oliver,This is Britney Turner. Her body shattered with broken bones and burns after being slammed into by a driver who was speeding away from Warren police who were in a high-speed pursuit this past June. This is Warren police video of officers getting Turner out of her burning car. Turner is suing Warren police for $60 million.
John Oliver,"No, I’m not. No, I’m not kidding you at all. Even when I say you look like Lex Luthor after two days of norovirus, I’m not kidding. I’m being deadly serious right now. And you should know the “bad guy” in question there was being pursued after police tried pulling him over for driving without a visible license plate."
John Oliver,"Now, to their credit, that local news station took that cop’s response to the woman who’d been hurt, and she was understandably unimpressed."
John Oliver,"Yeah, because it is. Specifically, it is bull-shit. And it’s frankly incredible that she’s exercising more restraint with her use of profanity than the cops did with a 4,000-pound vehicle."
John Oliver,"Also, at this point, can we please just let people say “shit” on the news? Whose innocence are we protecting anymore? I tried to play Halo last week because I’m thinking about getting into hobbies, and as soon as I logged on, a 10-year-old called me a cunt . The linguistic battle for decency has been lost."
John Oliver,"And look, I am not saying fleeing drivers are never at fault — of course they are. But law enforcement needs to be focusing on minimizing the risks of dangerous situations instead of exacerbating them. And unfortunately, even when officers flout policy and people die, they often avoid both criminal charges and internal discipline."
John Oliver,"But that probably shouldn’t be surprising, given all the barriers to police accountability. Many states have legal protections that make it very difficult to hold officers and agencies liable for chase-related injuries. In fact, that woman you just saw had her case dismissed because current Michigan law requires that unless the police car itself crashed into her, the police bear no liability — a decision that she is now appealing."
John Oliver,"And that is just the beginning here because, as we’ve discussed before, cops are also protected by what’s called the qualified immunity doctrine. Thanks to that, the Supreme Court hasn’t sided with any victim of a fatal police chase — even an innocent bystander — since it created qualified immunity, while at the same time steadily building up a body of case law that makes it even harder for families to sue."
John Oliver,"And even in one incredibly rare instance where cops were held criminally accountable for a death resulting from a chase — when a jury convicted two D.C. cops for their roles in a deadly chase of a man on a moped and a subsequent cover-up — Donald Trump pardoned them as one of his first acts in office. Which, in a different world — a better, kinder world, one worth saving — might have been a scandal."
John Oliver,"And I should say, even some law enforcement officers will tell you chases as they are currently practiced are just a recipe for needless death."
John Oliver,Exactly. And it’s honestly refreshing to hear someone in law enforcement state the obvious here instead of acting like society will fall apart if cops in Massapequa don’t get to Tokyo Drift.
John Oliver,"So, what can we do? Well, I would argue there are some simple steps that we can take."
John Oliver,"First, there should be national standards for how and when police can initiate a chase — like only allowing officers to conduct pursuits when a violent crime has been committed and the suspect poses an imminent threat to commit another one. As experts have explained, if an officer can apprehend a traffic law violator or a criminal offender through safer methods, then they should do so."
John Oliver,"On top of that, cities and states could pass laws that let individuals sue government officials and prohibit qualified immunity as a defense in state court."
John Oliver,"But something has to be done here, because the police’s commitment to public safety shouldn’t effectively end once they turn their sirens and lights on. And if a chase truly is like firing a 4,000-pound bullet, perhaps cars in this context should be treated as weapons — tools to be handled carefully and not deployed in every single scenario."
John Oliver,"Because despite what too many cops say and what TV and films have conditioned us to believe, the idea that high-speed pursuits are the only way to ensure public safety is, to borrow a word that this woman would not allow herself to say, absolute bullshit."
Main Segment,"Police chases in the United States Other segments: Effects of the 2025 United States federal government shutdown, John Oliver’s wine brand (Cabernet Sauvinjohn)"
Reporter,"There are some who will argue that it is law enforcement’s job to enforce the law, full stop. So when somebody flees from a traffic stop, they are violating the law, and it’s the duty of that law enforcement officer to pursue and to pursue until that pursuit is terminated. What do you say to those folks?"
Reporter,He was a passenger in the car.
Reporter,"Well, they might have."
Reporter,"They said there’s only one person responsible for you being hit and hurt like this, and it’s the person behind the wheel that they were pursuing. What do you think of that?"
Professor,"I call BS. We have camera networks all over the city. We have license plate readers all over. Once you know the identity of this person, turn this over to the investigators."
Professor,"Police are trained and are there to deal with people who aren’t making good decisions, can’t make good decisions, and there’s got to be an adult in the room, and it’s not the person fleeing."
John Bernell,"Part of the insanity of any pursuit is a seeming contradiction of responsibility. An officer is expected to be responsible for himself, his motor vehicle, innocent motorists, bystanders, and even the suspect. At the same time, he’s expected to catch up to a maniac on wheels who’s driving like a bat out of hell."
Sheriff,Am I happy that the young man died? No. But that was the position that he put himself in.
Sheriff,He still put himself in there ’cause he’s in that car with somebody that’s doing this.
Sheriff,Why didn’t they tell the driver to stop? Why didn’t they do that?
Officer,The bad guy strikes an innocent motorist yet we’re blamed. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?
Officer,"Last year, of our pursuits, 40% ended in a crash. So the numbers are just there, and then, you know, eventually, if you’re just chasing everyone just to chase everyone, you know, people are going to get killed."
Turner,"I think I can’t say the word that I want to say on camera, but I believe that that is bull."
